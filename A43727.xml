            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Take the boldneſs to preſent unto You this Eſſay on the Revelation of S. <hi>John;</hi> and I hope, for this my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and for prefixing your moſt worthy Name to this Diſcourſe, I ſhall not be judged either unſeaſonable or preſumptuous; Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering not only the great Honour and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I bear to your moſt Worthy Name and Perſon, but being alſo bound in Gratitude to Revive the Memory of that moſt Generous and Noble Family of the <hi>Chyvertons</hi> of <hi>Kerris,</hi> your Worthy Kinſmen: To whom I being obliged by ſo many real Benefits and neer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that I knew not how to manifeſt a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Retaliation, then by a Revival of their moſt Worthy Memories, in the Dedication of this Diſcourſe to your Worſhips Protection, who
<pb facs="tcp:53073:3"/>
is the only Surviving Branch of that Ancient and Truly Generous Family of the <hi>Chyvertons</hi> of our County of <hi>Cornwal.</hi> But by the way I ſhall take leave to aſſure you (being not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of the ends and ayms that moſt men lay before themſelves in ſuch <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi>) that it was leaſt in my intention to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix hereunto your Honourable Name, thereby to add a countenance to any private opinions of mine; much leſs was it in my eye to raiſe an eſteem upon my weak endeavours, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating the leaſt complyance in your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips judgement, in many things I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten herein; let them ſtand or fall according to the Truth and Reaſon therein manifeſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I quite diſclaim any ſuch pretences, in having any Intereſt in my Plea for this my Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto your Worthy Self: But if the leaſt meaſure of the Truth of God be herein found, I truſt it will be no diſhonour to your Self, nor to the greateſt amongſt men, that ſuch walk under the countenance of your Authority and great Names: But what herein ſhall juſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear heterodox and diſſentaneons from the Word of God, let it not have the leaſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or countenance from man, but let it rather be as an abortive birth, and dye for ever, never to have a reſurrection more.</p>
            <p>Thus having wiped off the ſiniſter Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations for this Application, In the next
<pb facs="tcp:53073:3"/>
place be pleaſed to take a view of what is here tendered, when the urgency of your great and important affairs will permit, it being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation on part of the Book of <hi>John's</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Propheſies, wherein God's various deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with his Church and people, as alſo with the Empires of the world under whoſe power they come under, are under moſt lively Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Repreſentations, and Hyerogliphique Figures, diſcovered and made known, even from the time of the giving of that Propheſie, unto the end of the world.</p>
            <p>And you know, 'tis a common Cuſtome amongſt moſt men, to get a Prognoſtication in the ending of the old year, to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Accidents and Events that are likely to be in the enſuing year. Lo, now, about the end of this year, I preſent You with this firſt part of this Divine Ephemerides, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the skilfulleſt Aſtronomer that ever was: There is now no need of upholding that wretched practice of running to the Wizards or Star-gazers, to know the Events and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of Churches, States, and Kingdoms: We have here a full Diſcovery from himſelf, who created the Stars, and knows their courſe, and calls them all by their Names; who looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bands of <hi>Orion,</hi> and binds up the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Pleiades.</hi> Men may conjecture, and their conjecture fail; they talk of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<pb facs="tcp:53073:4"/>
but never were there for a full diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but here then the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and he that created the Seas, telling and foretelling Signs and Wonders, not for a day, or a moneth, or a year, but for many years, even until the end of the World, not only the events of our preſent old year, but the accidents alſo of the New year: that is, of the other life. The Mathematicians of this world never dream'd of that great day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a thouſand years ſhould make up but one great and glorious day: Only this Book, the Saints great Almanack reports this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I believe it. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could not conceive that the World ſhould end, becauſe he never underſtood how it did begin: but behold a greater then <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is here. Chriſt hath taught of the end, and given Notes and Signs to diſcern this end.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but you will perceive and finde how ſingular uſeful the knowledge of theſe Propheſies will be to all perſons, but eſpecially to ſuch as have their hands much employed in the great Affairs of the World, ſo that when their Lord and Maſter cometh with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Angels to call them to an account of their Stewardſhip, how comfortable then will the contemplation be, that they in their ſeveral Generations have employed their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, Power, and Authority in the World,

for Chriſt and his people, againſt Antichriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I deſire not to be miſtaken in this, that I judge all is Antichriſt that many in theſe days call Antichriſt: I know there is a true real Antichriſt, an oppoſite ſtate to Chriſt and Truth, under the Viſor of Chriſt and Truth: It is not every difference in Judgement or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that makes up Antichriſt; indeed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> late I finde it a State-knack of ſeveral parties and factions to brand their adverſaries with thoſe odious ſtiles of Antichriſt, Heretiques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they may go undiſcovered, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch Titles better themſelves, or at leaſt wiſe, ſo to raiſe a Scar-crow, to drive away the fearful and diſ-ingenious from a full enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the Truths of God, that would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the vanity and folly of their oppoſers. But no more of this.</p>
            <p>And here by the way, I ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to acquaint you with one miſtake of mine, who once thought (as moſt men do) that God in his Providential diſpoſing the Kingdoms o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

into the Throne of Princes, and throwing down great Princes, and their Progenies, into the ſtate of ſlaves, it was only to manifeſt his Soveraignty over the Kingdoms of this world, to give them to whom he pleaſeth: but more maturely conſidering the All-wiſe ordering hand of God in ſuch great Tranſactions, I have found the iſſue in all Ages to be very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Church of God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of all ſuch State-ſhakings and Revolutions to be in mercy towards his Church and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When God broke the great <hi>Caldeo-Aſsyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Monarchy, and transferred it to the <hi>Medio-Perſian,</hi> how vvonderfully, and by vvhat ſtrange providence did God raiſe <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or inſtrument for that work? Who was expoſed to be deſtroyed by the command of his Grandſire <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> whiles an Infant, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of ſome fatal Propheſie, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and brought up amongſt Shepherds, as his Story goes, that afterwards he became moſt providentially the great deliverer of God's people (the Jews) from their <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> bondage. <hi>Moſes</hi> the great Captain of Iſrael, we are ſure trod almoſt the ſame path under a ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Preſervation, that at laſt he became the deliverer of Iſrael from their <hi>Aegyptian</hi> thraldome. When <hi>Saul</hi> was ſet by, who was of a Kingly Preſence, and by the Head and Shoulders above his brethren, <hi>David</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:53073:5"/>
from the Sheep-cot to the Throne, the iſſue whereof was, the exaltation of Iſrael, and the downfal of their enemies. If we ſhall but reflect ſince Chriſt's coming in the fleſh, on the example of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, Son unto <hi>Helena</hi> a Brittiſh Lady, who through many glorious and eminent Victories and Services, was at laſt advanced to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Seat, and how he at laſt became as a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Saviour to the Church of Chriſt, and Deſtroyer to the Kingdom of the Dragon, is moſt marvellous to conſider. It is worth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the taking notice of, how wonderfully God in late ages, raiſed the Spirits of ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure perſons, as <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates of the firſt Reformation, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reformed Miniſters ſince, that they have made the great Hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſhake with their Power; ſo that many Chriſtian Princes then, and ſince, began to hate the Whore, with the Wine of whoſe Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they were made drunken; and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin not only to hate her, but to make her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate and naked, and to eat her fleſh. But yet that age was but the firſt fruits, or Prodromus, not the conſummation of the work; for ſhe having ſince lifted up her head, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to cover her nakedneſs, and to cure her ſelf of her great Wound received, but all in vain, for her period drawing nigh, God exaſperates
<pb facs="tcp:53073:6"/>
her ſore more and more, and makes thoſe Horns, thoſe Princes that were once her ſtrong Supporters, to fall off from her, and to hate her. Indeed the firſt Reformers took off her outward garments, and ſhowed her nakedneſs in her falſe Doctrine, and partly in her falſe Worſhip, and then began to eat her Fleſh, in taking off ſome of her pompous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, but yet the main Work was left undone to its appointed time: For as this great City roſe not in one day, but gradually, ſo will alſo her ruine be by ſeveral Meaſures, or Vials of God's wrath poured out upon her, until the conſummation of her ruine come with fire, both Material and Analogical, the one the fire of God's Word, firſt deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite her falſe Worſhip, which day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie goes on in perfecting: the other, God's fire of War and Judgements, deſtroying quite up her outward State and Policy, that her place be no more found. And to the bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this great end, God works very variou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, ſomtimes in moving on the hearts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo makes them willing unto this work: ſomtimes in laying aſide Princes of ancient and potent Families, and raiſing up meaner and lower Perſons on their Thrones (as he moſt wonderfully hath done of late among our ſelves) to whom he gives Hearts, Spirits, and Gifts meet for this great work: and laſtly, in
<pb facs="tcp:53073:6"/>
over-ruling the deſigns of others, that though they go about to ſeek themſelves, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their own Dominion and Power of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet the All-wiſe providence of God knows how ſo to order them, as to bring about his predeſigned end: For I cannot believe that they will be all pious good Princes, and right in their ends, that ſhall be employed about this work; for they are the ten Horns, or ten Kings that receive power one hour with the Beaſt, and were Members of him that ſhall deſtroy the Whore, and burn her with Fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12.16. I am of the minde, that few conclude that <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and ſome other Princes were ſo juſtifiable in their ends in expelling the Authority of Antichriſt, as they ſhould have been, and yet God employed them as his Inſtruments in this Work: and when they have done his buſineſs, God knows how to lay them by, and all ſuch ſelf-ended perſons, as uſeleſs, or at leaſt, make them but as <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> or Hewers of Wood in the Houſe of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Your Worſhip may be pleaſed to take notice, that ſome conceive thoſe and the like Interpretations of dark Propheſies, to be but the iſſues of diſtempered brains, and of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle certainty. To whom I anſwer, Seeing that this is a Book that hath the publique impreſs of the Spirit in it, and left (as it were) as its
<pb facs="tcp:53073:7"/>
laſt Legacy of this ſort in the Church of Chriſt; I profeſs ſoberly, I know not what tolerable ſenſe to ſet on this Book of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, if it be not for an hiſtorical diſcovery, under Types and Figures, of all the Changes and Revolutions, with their Periods and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, that ſhould befal the Church of God, and their Oppreſſors and Enemies, until the end of all. I confeſs there may be ſome difference in Interpreting, and in not rightly Applying ſome of the ſeveral Characters, Periods, and Viſions of this Book, and in other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts thereof; and wherein I fail, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat not only your Worſhip, but all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to remember my weakneſs, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon attribute, <hi>Humanum eſt errare:</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially being amongſt ſuch Prophetical deeps and difficulties, which may well plead for his failings, who is conſcious of his inſufficiencies for ſo high and difficult an undertaking: Yet this I dare be bold to ſay, that the ſubſtantial part of this Propheſie is here cleared and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: And if any receive light hereby, to the better underſtanding the dark Myſteries thereof, give me leave to ſay with <hi>Daniel,</hi> cap. 2.28. <hi>There is a God in Heaven which reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Myſteries, to him be all the Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to You (worthy Sir) I have nothing more to add, nor for you a greater good to pray, then that God who having exalted you

in Authority and Power, into that likeneſs of himſelf, ſo he would Engrave upon you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther image or likeneſs of his own, true wiſdom, and give you an enlightned, wiſe (<hi>Solomon</hi>-like) diſcerning heart, whereby you may day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee more and more into the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcoveries of the Truths of God in this Book of Propheſies, and elſe-where, in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word of God; that you may have your ayms right, and your heart fixed to proſecute thoſe ends, and that in integrity, which God in your preſent Employments hath called you unto. The work of this preſent generation for all Chriſtian Worthies to ſet their hands and hearts to, being (as I conceive) if not to the downfal of the Throne of the Beaſt, yet at leaſt to the Eclipſing of the <hi>Auſtrian Sun,</hi> the great Pillar of the Antichriſtian State.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very well known, that amongſt moſt that are converſant in the profoundeſt Speculations, and in ſearching out hidden Verities, they are various in their Projects and their Cogitations, are uſually fixed upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ends. Some know, that they may be known: and this is vanity. Some know, that they may know, and this is curioſity. Others know that they may edifie, and this is charity. How diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the two former are to all judicious perſons, and how deſirable the latter is to all knowing Chriſtians, I need not inculcate. The latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my choice, I hope thy candour, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of my ends, will Apologize for me, in that I appear in Publique, now among the croud in Print, and at ſuch a time, wherein (as one
<pb facs="tcp:53073:9"/>
wittily obſerved, viz. <hi>Heylins Geogr. in folio 865.)</hi> The Treaſury of Learning was never ſo full, and yet never more empty; by reaſon of the many vain, frothy, and unneceſſary diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it abounds with, from the Scriblers and idle Paper-blurrers of theſe days; and if I have gone beſide my ſelf, to become one of that number, by playing the fool in Print, I muſt ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did to his <hi>Corinthians, 2</hi> Cor. <hi>5.13.

            <p>But if thou askeſt me to what end I fall upon this task of interpreting this Book of Propheſies, ſeeing many have already attempted it, whereof ſome are come off with loſs, yet others with more credit and proficiency?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Indeed in all our actions and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this kinde, we are to enquire in the firſt place <hi>Cui bono?</hi> To what good? for what end we do effect them? For the end crowns all our actions, and adds perfection to them: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or, <hi>Exitus actu probat:</hi> The excellency of our works appears and are diſtinguiſhed by their ends: Therefore though my labour herein may by ſome be accounted ſuperfluous, and my ſelf to be juſtly numbred among the former ſort, that have <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; Operam perdiderunt,</hi> that is, come off with loſs in their undertakings; yet I believe,
<pb facs="tcp:53073:9"/>
the indifferent and ingenious Reader will be of another minde concerning it, when God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him and my ſelf opportunity to go thorow with it; though I muſt confeſs, it will partake of much weakneſs and imperfections from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, yet I truſt, the Reader will find my ends high and honourable enough, and of ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to bear up my Spirits in the undertaking, and his in peruſing and conſidering. And although to ſome I may ſeem herein <hi>Actum agere,</hi> to fall upon a Theme fully already diſcuſſed by others; yet I am of opinion with that ſaying of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, Utile eſt plures Libros a pluribus fieri diverſo ſtilo, etiam de Queſtionibus iiſdem, ut ad plurimos res perveniat, ad alios ſic, ad alios autem ſic.</hi> That it is profitable to have Books compoſed of the ſame Works or Queſtions, in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and divers ſtile, that knowledge may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to very many, to ſome in one manner, to others after another.</p>
            <p>Though I ſhall not much boaſt of my imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in Interpreting and Applying thoſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Viſions, yet I aſsure the Reader, as far as I know mine own heart, it was ſingle and unbyaſſed in this undertaking, having firſt deſired God to guide my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Pen aright, to write no more then what did genuinely riſe from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and coherence of the Text, or what might be extracted therefrom by good conſequence, or what did naturally flow from the proper tendency
<pb facs="tcp:53073:10"/>
of the Figures and Hierogliphique characters of each Viſion in this Book, interpreted, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to private Judgement, nor unto the Intereſt of any Party or Faction (being free from any ſuch pre-engagements) all which are to be laid aſide in all ſuch undertakings, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his followers (as great incumbrances) when he went into the Mount to confer with the Lord in Prayer. I truſt the candid Reader ſhall finde the Divine Myſteries of this Book of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Opened and Applyed, according to the minde of the Spirit, therein (for the main) made evident by the proper characters of each Viſion, and according to that full compleat Spirit of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that runs through this whole Book of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Propheſies. I confeſs I may come ſhort of ſome Learned Men who have gone herein before me, to whoſe Labours I muſt juſtly acknowledge a due Tribute, being aſsiſted thereby unto this Work: And though I cannot juſtly apply that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s to my cauſe (for it would ſavour of too much vanity and ſelf-exalting) <hi>Recentiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima quaeque ſunt emandata magis:</hi> yet this I may boldly adventure to ſay, That thou ſhalt find ſuch variety of Collections, Obſervations, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and Truths herein Diſcuſſed, not ordinary in any former Writers hereupon, that will yeild thee (if an ingenious perſon) no ſmall delight and profit in Reading, Pondering, and Treaſuring up the ſame. The variety of Flowers makes
<pb facs="tcp:53073:10"/>
the ſweeteſt Poſie: and various Diſcording, yet harmonizing Sounds, makes the ſweeteſt Muſick; So variety of Truths and Queſtions Diſcuſsed, will yeild the greater pleaſure and profit to the Reader. And though I muſt needs ſay that many that went before me on this Theme, did excel in true Piety, Learning, and Parts, yet ſaving due reſpects both to the Perſons and their Parts, it is not at all ſtrange, if that we in this Age, being advanced by their help upon their own ſhoulders, and coming nearer unto the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the events and the end of all, ſhould ſee a little further in the Truth of theſe myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Propheſies, then they that went before us, and no diſcredit to them, be they ever ſo Godly and Learned. I have obſerved that ſome (and no mean Ones) that are gone before on this Theme, are not without their <hi>Maculae</hi> and Defects, and more eſpecially, in that they have appeared of too private and narrow a Spirit in their Interpreting and applying the Propheſies of this Book unto their own times, Intereſts, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; as if the Actions and Revolutions of every petty City, and Commonweal, yea, the ends, Deſigns, and Periods of every Perſon that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence exalts in Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſomwhat beyond the common boundaries of the ordinary Lords and Rulers of the Nations, were Compriſed, Predicted, Fore-told, and Propheſied of in this Book of Revelations; and
<pb facs="tcp:53073:11"/>
ſo by this means makes ſtrange and wilde Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Viſions and Myſteries of this Book: And where this conceit works ſtrongly, it will work madly too; when once it is elevated to that height and gets a power, then there muſt be no oppoſing of thoſe Ends and Deſigns that ſuch Opinioniſts pretends as juſt Collections from the Propheſies of this Book; which they interpret according to their own Fancies, and have only a Being (as wilde <hi>Chymeras,</hi> in their own deceived Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>This is that Rock whereon ſome have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made Shipwrack, and periſhed thereon, and others now adays are Sayling with a full gale to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſame <hi>Charybdis;</hi> and if God in Mercy prevent not, will thereon ſplit and periſh alſo.

This laſt, the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this dangerous Rock, was not the leaſt End that I ſet before me in this undertaking: Which Ends, for better ſatisfaction, I ſhall here more particularly ſet down in Order.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> My firſt was (next Gods Glory, and the advancement of his Truth) for the keeping the Saints feet ſtreight, in not ſtumbling by a falſe Interpreting and Applying of this Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies: and in vainly endeavouring the ſetting up of the Kingdom of Chriſt before the time; and
<pb facs="tcp:53073:11"/>
in the pulling down all Authority that oppoſe ſuch Pretenders, to their own utter ruine and undoing without Repentance.</p>

As it was once ſaid by <hi>Auguſtine, Prodeſt ſcriben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do; &amp; ſcribendo prodeſt:</hi> We having all (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> teſtifies) longing deſires, <hi>conjungi cum ſuo principio;</hi> to be conjoyned with our principle.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> To redeem the time, having ſpent many precious hours and days in folly, and been exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unto others in evil doing: So there is all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhould redeem the time: and God calls in this day of light, both from my ſelf, and all others, that we ſhould be patterns unto others in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if that poſſibly we may redeem the loſt time of our youth and folly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That God may have his ends and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the work of our Creation, we being born not
<pb facs="tcp:53073:12"/>
alone for our ſelves, but for the work of our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to ſerve God therein faithfully, in all the relations that he calls us to. God hath not ſent us into this world to ſpend away all our precious days in ſports, paſtimes, and follies, or about the more profitable affairs of this preſent world, as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of too too many is; but to ſacrifice ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent part thereof unto the ſervice of our God and Chriſt, that our friends, neighbours, relations, and poſterity, may take encouragements and examples by us, to live more unto the praiſe of God and their Creator.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid down my ends in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, I have this more to acquaint thee with. This Exercitation being ſent forth as my Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in this kinde, in publique unto the world, the ſecond being intended alſo, on this whole Book of Divine Propheſies, if God doth continue but his wonted mercies and encouragements thereunto: This firſt is more Practical and Doctrinal, and therefore I have herein followed a method with Obſervations and Notes, which the ſecond will not ſo commodiouſly admit; the great work of that being to demonſtrate the truth of each Propheſie, and how the Myſteries, Figures, and Characters thereof are to be interpreted, underſtood, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to their proper times, periods, States, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and revolutions repreſented by them: But this firſt being more practical, and treating of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Queſtions that are under diſpute now in theſe
<pb facs="tcp:53073:12"/>
days, I thought it fit to let this ſee the light in the firſt place, to try how it will taſte upon the pallates of the godly ingenious; for if it ſavours well with them, it will ſuffice, and be a farther encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the ſecond. I know I ſhall not pleaſe all in this Writing, neither was there ever a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with whom all have been ſatisfyed; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Ad captum Lectoris habent ſua fata Libelli.</l>
                  <l>Books do either hit or miſs,</l>
                  <l>As the Readers Judgement is.</l>
               </q>
Neither indeed was it in my thoughts to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the ſatisfacton of all, well knowing that there are ſome ſo prepoſſeſſed with prejudice, or at leaſt, ſo wedded to their own conceits, that it were the greateſt unreaſonableneſs and ſervility in the World, to captivate ones reaſon to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their overweening folly. It was alſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath my Deſigne to accommodate my Writings to the popular applauſe, and as the Tragedian ſays, <hi>Populo ut placerent;</hi> who commonly weigh not the matter by the truth and Scriptural reaſon, but by their own irregular fancies and affections: and therefore am far from their humour, who <hi>Nil rectum reputant, niſi quod placuit ſibi ducunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next I ſhall acquaint the ingenious Reader, That if any of my concluſions recede from the truth of Scriptures, I could willingly wiſh all ſuch an abortion in the very birth: But if any thereof ſeem only to diſcede from the common received
<pb facs="tcp:53073:13"/>
Opinions: let the Ingenious conſider, So long as they are Warranted by the Authority of Scripture and Reaſon, I hope I ſhall not want a Protector, or a ſufficient Defence and Apologie.</p>
            <p>I have no more to add in this way of Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing unto the Reader, but if he be a friend unto the Truths herein diſcuſſed, I wiſh him a farther increaſe of Divine light: If he be malevolent thereunto, all the harm I wiſh him, is a better Spirit, and a more enlightned Judgement: If he be ſupine and negligent, I wiſh him to add dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and prayers to God for a right enquiry: If he be ignorant, I wiſh him a greater meaſure of true light and ſound knowledge: If he be ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally judicious and learned, I wiſh him to ſearch and enquire diligently (true <hi>Berean</hi>-like) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are ſo or not, and declare it forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others: So ſhall he deliver his own ſoul, and his Brothers alſo from the ſnares of death.

            <p>GOD ſpake at ſundry times in old time to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, after a diverſe manner by his Servants the Prophets: but now in theſe later dayes hee ſpeaks unto us by his Son, and his Ambaſſadours, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt: And hee that would deſire to know the minde of God towards his people and Church, may by the bleſſing of God, and the Spirit of Grace moving on his endeavours, in ſearching, meditating, and inquiring into the Word of God, (both Old and New) not only finde out that Treaſure (where out floweth both New and Old things) that will make his ſoule wiſe unto ſalvation; but alſo hee ſhall finde a treaſure of wiſedom that will repleniſh his ſoule, (whiles here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in all the changes of this World,) with a great deale of Peace and Comfort. For what will add greater hopes, or be a ſurer prop to a ſoule in the time of its Affliction and mourning, then to fore ſee, know, and be aſſured, (next to its intereſt in Chriſt) of the day of it's deliverance? This hath been the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary portion and Lot of every ſoule that is truly Intereſſed in Chriſt Jeſus thorow their ſeverall Generations, for the Servant muſt not look to be greater then his Maſter; Chriſt entered into his glory by Sufferings, Temptations, ſorrows, and the way of the Croſſe; his members muſt drink the ſame cup with him, whiles here militant, though not, to the ſame meaſure, nor to the ſame ends; for herein they are not made mighty to bear: his ſufferings were to give ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, that hee that knew no ſin might be made ſin for us, that we thereby might become the Sons and Children of God. Our ſufferings are for the Exerciſe of our graces, and to fullfil the remainder of the ſufferings of the Myſticall Body of Chriſt in our ſelves, in our Journying towards our Celeſtial <hi>Canaan.</hi> And this hath not only been the portion of particular members but of the whole Body, the true Church of God in all ages, as appeares by the Hiſtory thereof. Yet notwithſtanding, our gracious God to manifeſt his Fatherly overſight, and faithful providence and goodneſs, which hee without Intermiſſion diſpenſeth towards his Church and people, hath often, for a Comfort to the Godly, and warning to
<pb facs="tcp:53073:14"/>
the wicked, not only delivered them from their oppreſſours, and ſet them above them; but ſo prefixed the time of their diſtreſſes and deliverances, that both they and their enemies themſelves, in obſerving the events, muſt needs acknowledge the All-wiſe hand of Gods providence, to the one for good, to the other in wrath and Judgment. God hath promiſed hee will not be angry with his for ever, God hath his acceſſes and his receſſes, his comings in, and his withdrawings towards his Church: Some are conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as if we keep with God hee will be found of us; but if we forſake him, he will forſake us. Some again are abſolute, and out of Soveraignty, as that, <hi>I will be found of them that ſought me not,</hi> &amp;c. Yet however, Gods purpoſe of doing good to his Church is ſo ſtedfaſt and unalterable, that though many of them run upon the performance of ſome precedent conditions or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in his people, yet he will in faithfulneſs perform his promiſes towards them in their deliverance, either by making them a fit people for ſo great a mercy by working the condition in them, and ſo will make them a willing people in the day of his power: or otherwiſe rather then any of the promiſes ſhall fall to ground unaccompliſhed will do it abſolutely of his good will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Before the Floud God gave 120. years reſpit to the old World before he would execute his Judgment upon them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. When this time was expired his Spirit would contend with them no longer, but God came with the Floud and deſtroyed all living, except <hi>Noah,</hi> and what was with him in the Ark.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God declared to <hi>Abraham</hi> that his ſeed ſhould bee a ſtanger in a Land that was not theirs, in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſhould ſerve them and they ſhould afflict them for 400. years, but withall that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom they ſhould ſerve hee would judge, and afterwards they ſhould come out with great ſubſtance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13, 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which promiſe God did fulfill moſt faithfully unto them in its due time, and after the expiration of the ſaid Terme hee brought out his people with a mighty and ſtrong Arme, in drowning the Hoſt of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the red Sea.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To that Captivity in <hi>Babylon</hi> God ſets a period of 70. years, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 29.10. when that time was accompliſhed; God ſtirred up the Spirit of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to let the people go.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To <hi>Daniel</hi> God ſhewed, that 70. weeks, <hi>viz.</hi> weeks of years being 490. years were to bee determined, in which time the <hi>Meſsias</hi> ſhould come and be cut off, and at length the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſtroyed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26. <hi>verſes.</hi> And how all theſe things were fully accompliſhed is moſt evident to every one that knows any thing of Gods dealings towards his Church and people.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In like manner there is a certain time ſet and determined upon the Church of God in the new Teſtament, how long ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:53073:14"/>
ſhall be expoſed to perſecution and when ſhe ſhall be delivered from it, which is expreſſed in the Prophet, <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.25. and the 12.7. They (the Saints) ſhall be given unto the fourth Beaſts hand untill a time, times, and the dividing of time. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Daniel</hi> does anſwer that of <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. The Woman which is the Church of God ſhall be in the Wilderneſs and trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot by the power of the Beaſt for a time, times and half a time, which is to ſay, as it is explained in the ſixth verſe of the ſame <hi>Chapter</hi> 1260. dayes or years, which terme for the comfort of the Saints the power of the Beaſt cannot exceed. For he that hath ſet a bound and period to all Kingdoms and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires in this World hath ſaid it, hither thou ſhalt go &amp; no farther. And that Angel in the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.7. held up his right hand and left hand to Heaven, and ſware by him that liveth for ever that it ſhould be but for a time, times, and half.</p>
            <p>It being then clearly evinced that God will in his appointed time viſit his Church with ſure mercy, and having prefixed in all ages the time and continuance of their Diſtreſſes and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that in the day of his viſitation, he will come with a certain deliverance to his people, and ruine to his enemies: it is matter of great Joy &amp; comfort to his people to be forewarned of this time, &amp; fore ſee it though long before it come to bear up their Spirits in there greateſt afflictions and diſtreſſes: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſts day and bleſſed God, though ſeeing it afar of by faith. This God hath more eſpecially done in this Book of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it being a diſcovery unto the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in Prophetical repreſentations and Hierogliphique figures of all the Empires, States and Kingdoms, both Ethnick and Antichriſtian, with their ſeverall uſurpations and oppreſſions over the Church of God, which ſhould happen from <hi>Iohn's</hi> time unto the end of the World, together with the iſſue thereof, the finall deſtruction of the one and the exaltation of the other before the ultimate end of all.</p>
            <p>But here by the way it will be objected and ſaid that this Book is full of hidden myſteries and ſealed, and very difficult to be underſtood, and therefore moſt of thoſe that have eſpouſed their ſtudies to the opening of this Book, have come of with loſſe in their over bold undertaking.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I Anſwer, this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> is indeed full of myſteries which will ſo remain untill the accompliſhment thereof do diſcover them unto us, and make them manifeſt: But when we by the obſervation of the events do ſee before our eyes the effect of each Propheſie, and what by this and that thing hath been meant, it is now no longer a myſtery unto us. It is now obvious to every eye what is meant by myſtery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, the Mother of Harlots, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.6. This the Spirit of God doth clear up in the ſame Chapter to be, the City with ſeven heads
<pb facs="tcp:53073:15"/>

                  </gap>p.</hi> 14. <hi>Page</hi> 144. &amp;c. That by this great City here is meant Rome, likewiſe, all interpreters of the Reformation do harmoniouſly accord that by the Beaſt of ſeven heads and ten horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13 1. muſt be meant the Romiſh Empire divided into ten Kingdoms. And the Beaſt with two horns like a Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. yet ſpeaking like a Dragon, to be the Popiſh Antichriſtian Hierarchy, and if events hath plainly evidenced theſe without contradiction ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and interpreted, as in the progreſſe of this diſcourſe will more fully appear, why then ſhould if ſeem ſtrange that the reſidue of the myſteries of this Book ſhould be unlocked and made obvious as well as the former? Since the Spirit of God it ſelf in the 17. <hi>Chapter</hi> hath laid the firſt ground work, from whence as from a ſure foundation we may have a view of the whole <hi>Revelation,</hi> by collating Hyſtories, times and paſſages one with another, and lay them to their ſeveral characters and periods which the Spirit hath affixed to every remarkable revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, paſſage and Propheſie in this Book as a ſure token and touch-ſtone to finde them out, and make them manifeſt. So that now the <hi>Revelation</hi> is no longer a myſtery, but a Book of Hiſtory of memorable Acts and paſſages. Wherein is fore told the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral changes that ſhall befall to the ſecular State or Roman Empire, and to the Church of Chriſt under the Dominion of that Empire, untill it ſhall, as that ſtone propheſied of in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. Smite the Image on his feet and become it ſelf a great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſet up upon the top of all Mountains. And if we compare the Hiſtoryes and changes that hath hapned in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire with the Revelation, we ſhall diſcover clearly how far the accompliſhments reacheth, and what we may expect ere long: So that the things repreſented in this Book are no more myſteries and hidden things, but as clear and accompliſhed Acts unto us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The very Title and firſt entrance into the firſt Chapter, firſt verſe of this Book denies it to be a hidden miſtery, no farther then before the events do diſcover themſelves; for it is called the Apocalypſe or the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt which God gave unto him to ſhew unto his Servants which ſhortly muſt be done, which hee ſent and ſhewed by his Angel unto his Servant <hi>Iohn.</hi> Beſides it is contrary to the clear letter of the Text that it ſhould be a Book ſhut and ſealed; for in the 6. Chapter <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. The Lambs is found worthy to open the ſealed Book, and ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are made unto <hi>Iohn:</hi> and by him to all the Church of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That little Book mentioned in Chap. 10. which more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="tcp:53073:15"/>
containes the fate or deſtiny of the Church to the end of the World was an open book, and the Son of God in the end of the Revelation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.10. plainly prohibiteth to ſeale the ſayings of the Propheſie of this book for the time is at hand.</p>
            <p>Therefore this hence clearly follows, to ſet a check upon our ſupine and overly looking on this book: We would rather have it ſealed and hidden, (though the Son of God teſtifies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) then to beſtow our induſtry with the help of the Spirit of God to ſeeks out the minde of the Spirit in it. Truths are like treaſures got by the foreſt labours, are moſt ſweet and precious, but with all ſuch ſlowbellies that think there is a <hi>Lyon</hi> in the way, I leave with them theſe conſiderations. Is it the Book or Word of God or not? If it is (as I hereafter ſhall clearly evince) then ſtudy it; Some good will come to the ſoule by it: No Word of God is of private interpretation, or written in vain, it will ſtand in great ſtead. Yea in the <hi>Alpha</hi> of this book and the <hi>Omega</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the firſt and laſt Chapters, there is a bleſſing ſtored up for them that read, and they that learn the words of this Propheſie, and keep thoſe things which are written therein, for the time is at hand, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And ſhall there a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing be promiſed to all theſe that read, hear and keep the words of this Propheſie, and he that hath promiſed being moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perform? Yea theſe things ſaith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flaming fire <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.18. Theſe things ſaith hee that is holy and true, <hi>Chap</hi> 3.7. Theſe things ſaith the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithfull and true wittneſſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.14. And ſo cloſes in the laſt Chapter <hi>ver.</hi> 6. that theſe ſayings are faithfull and true, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhall firſt paſs away before one jota or tittle of the Word of God, ſhall fall to the ground unaccompliſhed, I ſay ſhall there a bleſſing be promiſed upon ſo faithful grounds, and wilt thou not look after it? I ſhould judge bleſſedneſs worth the looking after ſeeing that hee that hath promiſed is moſt ready, willing and able to perform.</p>
            <p>But if it demanded, what is the advantage? what is this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that may accrue in reading, hearing and keeping the words of this Propheſy? I anſwer much every way, both to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſoule and to the whole Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt if there were no more in it, but the detecting and making manifeſt of the Antichriſtian whore or ſtate and the pollutions thereof, and ſo give a warning to all Gods people to come out of her, and not to partake of her iniquities leaſt they be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of her plagues. Is it not a bleſſing to keep their ſouls unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed from Antichriſts pollutious, and to be delivered from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due thereunto? Was it not a great bleſſing for <hi>Lot</hi> to be fore told and delivered out of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> So is it not a ſingular bleſſing and mercy unto us and the Church of Chriſt to be delivered, and freed from the divine wrath
<pb facs="tcp:53073:16"/>
that is gone out againſt ſpirituall or miſticall <hi>Babylon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not a great priviledge and bleſſing to the people of God, to know the cataſtrophe and reſult of all their troubles, and to have a ſure word of Propheſie, for their deliverance from the oppreſſions and cruelties of their enemies, and that they ſhall one day triumph over them to their vtter ruine and deſtruction? Is not this able to beat up their Spirits in all their fiery Tryals, to ſee that their deliverance draweth nigh? Is it not a bleſſing in the day of affliction, in the day of mourning to be kept faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes unto our God? And though Satan and his depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Antichriſt have power over us to overcome and afflict us, yet we are theſe that are ſealed in the foreheads with the mark of the Lamb?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not a bleſſing to know that Antichriſts raign is but 42. moneths a certain definite time, which is now drawing to its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod? Is it not a bleſſing to know that the time of the woman in the Wilderneſs, and the witneſſes mourning in ſackcloth, the treading down the true Church of Chriſt and the Profeſſours thereof is but for 1260. dayes, which term is alſo neer expiring? Is it not a great bleſſing after all the troubles and afflictions of the Church and Saints here on earth to be aſſured, that Chriſt their head with Myriads of his Angels and Saints departed, will appear to the finall deſtroying of all their enemies and giving them peace and reſt, cauſing them to raign on earth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, is it not a great bleſſing to have a promiſe of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Communion of Chriſt and his glorified Saints, here on earth for a thouſand years? When mortality ſhall put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, when we ſhall ſee and know all the myſteries of God in Chriſt as we are ſeen and known, when that which is perfect is come, that which is imperfect ſhall be done away, when we ſhall ſee no longer in a glaſs, through weak and dark ordinances, but then we ſhall ſee face to face, when all our ordinances will be in a higher and more ſpiritual key, when ſorrow, ſin, and death ſhall be ſwallowed up of victory, when we ſhall walk in the light of the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the Lambs Wife that comes down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, wherein dwelleth true righteouſneſs. And ſhall all thoſe things be diſcovered in this Book of the Revelation, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thereof, and of bleſſedneſs to all thoſe that keep the words of this Propheſy, and yet will any be ſo ſtupid to conclude, that this is a dry uſeleſs book? That treats of Chriſtianity from its very riſe to the conſummation thereof, full fraught with aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of uſefull Obſervations to ſteer our feet aright in our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant courſe here, untill we ſhall all come to the full ſtature of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome ſay it is a moſt difficult Book to interpret, and that many able Expoſitors have come off with loſs in their ſtudies about it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53073:16"/>I anſwer firſt, that all things to the ſluggard indeed are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; The pith, marrow and ſubſtance of the Revelations is not to be found out by a courſary reading thereof, it is not obvious to every ey: And this is intimated in that 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is obſervable, that bleſſedneſs is entailed to reading, hearing and keeping the words of the Propheſy: it is not a bare reading or hearing that will entitle to this bleſſedneſs, but it muſt be keeping, treaſuring up, pondering and digeſting before it will produce the happy fruits of bleſſedneſs. Indeed there are, <gap reason="foreign">

The weakeſt may ſee ſo much as ſhall make him wiſe unto ſalvation, and the higheſt capacity can attain no more, and when it hath done all yet it muſt needs confeſs that it is not omniſcient, but that there are ſome miſteries in the Word of God, that will be ſtill miſteries unto it until the day of the Revelation of Chriſt ſhall come, wherein hee will teach us all things.</p>

            <p n="2">2. It is difficult to all ſuch that are not verſed in the old and modern Romane Hiſtories, not knowing how to apply the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and repreſentations of this Propheſy to their ſeveral times and periods: Neither knoweth how to diſtinguiſh the times of the revolutions and changes, but confound ſeveral things ſpoken of diverſe States one with another: Not obſerving where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the ſecular or civil ſtate, and whereof the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick, conceiving that the Revelation is as a continued Hiſtory, or Relation of events ſucceeding one another in the ſame order and cauſe as the viſions are reveiled in: And for want of due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation herein many interpreters have ſtumbled, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding, perverting and diſturbing the whole method and harmony of the Revelation, in making ſeveral epacts and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of time, ſo placing things which muſt come to paſs after the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the Beaſt before it: Whereas the paſſages of the Revelation are ſo related one to the other, though written in order one after another, that many thereof do concur in one and the ſame time; ſo that hee that goeth about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them in order of time as they lye in the book; in order of place, without the obſervation of the methd, oharmony and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
<pb facs="tcp:53073:17"/>
which is to be obſerved in all the paſſages of this book, falling under the ſame ſyncroniſme or concurrencies of times, indeed to ſuch this Book of the Revelation muſt needs remain full of difficulty, miſtery and obſcurity: And ſo the whole order of the Revelation together with themſelves are rendred in-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable and confounded. Whereas indeed the Spirit of God in this Book as a wiſe and well verſed Hiſtorian is wont to do in the deſcription of humane actions, does rightly diſtinguiſh of all the Revolutions and changes both of the civil and eccleſiaſtick ſtates, and though many of them are done and acted together and at the ſame time by diverſe and ſundry Perſons, yet cannot be declared together, but ſeverally one after another. So theſe Propheſies though revealed and ſet down in order of place one preceding the other, yet in vain do they go about to interpret them that obſerve not the peculiar characters and hidden miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of numbers ſyncroniſing, and meeting in one and the ſame time: which is indeed the great key of the Revelation, which makes all the paſſages and Revolutions therein, though at the firſt ſight they ſeem abſtruſe and diſturbed, yet by collating one to the other they become plain and revealed to us, which in the ſubſequent diſcourſe will manifeſt it ſelf. And theſe have been ſome of the reaſons that ſome former interpreters have come off with loſſe in their ſtudies and expoſitions of this Book: when as they have applied diverſe paſſages in this book, to their own times, when they had no relation to them: and ſometimes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as they are in order ſet down in the Book following one another, whereas they ſhould be interpreted as they are <hi>Relata</hi> and <hi>

Now becauſe ſome expoſitours have herein gone aſtray, muſt there no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be made into this Book?

            <p n="3">3. I anſwer to the perciſeneſs of the time of the Apocalip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique

periods, though I will not herein be too peremptory, well knowing that in matters of Hiſtory &amp; Chronology, there is great variety of opinions and imperfection therein, as it is manifeſt in <hi>Scaligerde Emendatione temporum,</hi> and other accounts alſo treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſame ſubject: yet all this doth not hinder, but the times and periods are fixed in the predeterminate Counſels of God, which are higher then the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> unalterable and unchangeable. And though notwithſtanding there is difference and imperfection in moſt accounts of times, yet by a regular judgment drawn from the viſible tokens, chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, image and repreſentation of each time, which are either concomitants, contemporaries or immediate antecedents or conſequents of each great revolution and change: we may judge their periods either to be paſt, drawing nigh at hand, or yet to come. And this is no more then Chriſt himſelf hath done in ſetting down remarkable forerunning as Signes, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and his leaſt comming in the 24. of <hi>Matth.</hi> and the 13. of <hi>Mark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would deſire alwayes to be underſtood, when I ſet down the exact epacts and periods of time, it may vary as unto us in preciſeneſs of account in reſpect of the imperfection of our Chronology, but long time it cannot miſs, every notable revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſeaſon having their own proper characters and tokens, to point them out as it were with a finger: which will notably help us peremptorily to conclude (in the foreſaid limited ſenſe.) This time is the time of Antichriſts birth and riſing: this of his raign, this of his ruine and deſolation. Conſider to this end that of the Angel in the Prophet <hi>Daniel, Chap.</hi> 12.7. Who held up his right hand, and left hand unto Heaven, and ſware by him that liveth for ever, that it ſhall be for a time, times and half. And the Son of God in the Revelation 13.14. hath ſhewed that the Beaſt and falſe Prophet ſhall have power over the Saints for 42. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and that the time of the woman in the Wilderneſs, and the time of the witneſſes Propheſying in ſackcloth to be 1260. dayes. Theſe things ſaith the <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithfull and true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: who would not then believe him? Seeing that Antichriſts raign, and the time of the Saints mourning is in the Eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God limited and prefixed, and that which the Angel and the Son of God do teſtifie with a great oath, we have no reaſon to doubt of, but that they will come to paſs in their ſeveral periods and appointed ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>Again, againſt the definite demonſtration of the laſt times, and ſeaſons and the great changes and revolutions, held forth in this Book of the Revelation, two Scriptures offers themſelves, that of our Saviours to his Diſciples in <hi>Mark</hi> 13.32. ſpeaking of the laſt day and of his ſecond comming. But of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither
<pb facs="tcp:53073:18"/>
the Son but the Father, the other is that of the <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt anſwereth his Diſciples queſtion, wilt thou at this time reſtore again the Kingdom unto <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And hee ſaid unto them it is not for you to know the time and the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power, ſo the objection lyes thus. If no man, no not Chriſt the Son of Man, nor the Angels of Heaven knows the laſt day, but that times and ſeaſons are left alone in the power of the Father, how then commeth it to paſs that there is a diſcovery of times and ſeaſons, and of the laſt day it ſelf and end of all made out unto <hi>John,</hi> in this Revelation by Chriſt himſelf?</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, we muſt know that in Chriſt, there was two natures diſtinct and unconfounded to make up one Perſon of a mediatour, and the property of each nature did remain entire unto each: hee was true God and true Man: and as hee was Man or the Son of Man, it is no derogation at all unto him to affirm that he knew not all things, and that according to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Man to be ignorant of ſome things, and ſo of the laſt day. But to affirm it as he is God being one in Counſel, nature, and eſſence with the Father from all eternity, it would be no leſs then blaſphemy to affirm it, for ſhall the Creatour of all things be ignorant of his handy-work?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was not the injunction or command of his Father on him whiles he converſed here on earth, to diſcover unto the World what ſhould happen in the latter dayes. Of the ſame comfort is that Scripture, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.40. being an anſwer to the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> to ſit on his right hand or his left was not his to give, yet in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.21. he promiſeth to him that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that he ſhall ſit down with him in his Throne. This Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture gives a fair light to an interpretation of the former: for whiles he was here beneath perfecting the work of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption here on earth; the Revelation was not given unto him, from the Father to diſcover times and ſeaſons: nor to give Thrones, Powers and Kingdoms into the hands of his Saints, untill after his reſurrection when all power was given unto him by the Father, and all things were then given into his hand by right of purchaſe. And this is that that is clearly intimated in the <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When none was found worthy to open the Book, then the 24. elders before the Throne ſang a new ſong, ſaying, thou art worthy to take the book and to open the ſeales thereof, for thou waſt ſlain, and hath redeemed us to God by thy bloud of every kindred, tongue, people and Nation. The opening of this book being as it were referred to the merit of his death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo that it ſhould not ſeem ſtrange that he knew not the day of his ſecond comming, neither having not as yet ſuffered nor entered into his glory. The Revelation of all things being reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Father for Chriſt unto that day.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:53073:19"/>3. That place of the <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7. is nothing to the purpoſe. It was not for his Diſciples to know then the fitteſt and moſt meet time, which God thought good at that time not to make known, to reſtore the Kingdom unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he doth not anſwer them that he will not reſtore the Kingdom unto <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But it was not now fit for them to know the time and ſeaſon thereof; Chriſt here ſpeaks of <hi>de tempore Tempeſtivo,</hi> of the opportune and fit time and ſeaſons, which the Father does reſerve in his own power, and will not reveale unto his people.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I anſwer that in this eſſay, I do conſider the time of the riſe, progreſſe and period of Antichriſt and other the great events, Syncronizing with the ſame in an Indefinite and more general way, not in an exact, definite preciſe day and hour, here I only conſider the years in a more general way, which now the Father hath not reſerved as a ſecret in his own power, but revealed them to us by his Son in this of the Revelation and other books of God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly accounting it as labour loſt to anſwer the vain inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations and gloſſes of the allegorizing and Chymical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturiſts, to wit the Familiſtical Notioniſts, who can extract <hi>quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet ex quolibet,</hi> and ſo make the Revelation indeed a miſtery and book ſealed to the wiſeſt Chriſtian, therefore I ſhall not at all meddle with them, when as they interpret according to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies of their own confuſed brains, and not according to the leaſt meaſure of ſound knowledge. For indeed if this book be not opened according to the Prophetical viſions, with their peculiar characters rightly applied to their ſeveral times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we ſhall not know what tollerable ſence or expoſition to ſet upon it.</p>
            <p>It is well that the Spirit of God it ſelf doth clearly diſcover, and demonſtrate in the 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> the beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns to be a government or Empire, that ſhould ariſe under ten Kings: And that miſtery of <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, and the woman ſitting upon many waters, to be that great City ſcituated upon ſeven hils, and which doth raign over the Kings of the earth. Now if the Spirit of God it ſelf hath holpen us with this key to unſhut in part the miſteries of the Revelation, it ſhould not be accounted preſumption in us to fall on the ſame method, in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of the Prophetical repreſentations and figures of this book, when as the Spirit of God hath given us ſome firſt fruits thereof it ſelf, as ſure footſteps to tread in: From which diſcovery of the Spirit, we may as from a watch-tower, take a full veiw of the reſt of the Revelation, and ſo a ſcanding of the whole book otherwiſe in it ſelf inacceſſible.</p>
            <p>And that thy Servant, O Chriſt who in himſelf is too weak for ſuch a work may be fitted in ſome meaſure, from thy ſelf who art the Wiſdom of God, and to whom the Revelation of all
<pb facs="tcp:53073:19"/>
things is given of the Father, becauſe thou art found worthy, O do thou enlighten his minde with true Light from above: And remove all impediments, his iniquities out of thy ſight, by the waſhing of thine own bloud, then thou maiſt diſcover thy minde unto thy poor Servant, being hallowed by thy ſelf to a fruitful reception thereof: Grant O Chriſt that by thy favour and the guidance of thy good Spirit, he may diligently conſider the miſteries of this Book, and that unto ſobriety, and declare it forth unto others, that the Church of God, may receive ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by him. And if thy Servant, O Lord, hath herein through weakneſs, built any hay and ſtubble upon thy precious ſtructure, O let it be conſumed, but ſo as that thy Servant may be ſaved in the great day of the Lord God Almighty, but if any of thine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good hereby, to thee for it, as moſt due, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty, be praiſe, glory and <hi>Dominion,</hi> for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53073:23"/>3. In the laſt place, I ſhall give a compendious view and taſte of the ſcope and deſigne of the whole Book.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the Divine Authority of this Book, I ſhould ſay very little or nothing unto it, well knowing how dangerous it is to move Foundation ſtones, or to queſtion the Authority of any of the Books of God, received reverently in the Churches of Chriſt from age to age, as the Canon and Rule of their Faith and Manners. If it were not that the Adverſary of old took advantage by this artifice to hinder the growth, and caſt prejudice on many of the Truths of God, and to weaken the comforts of his Saints, mainly cheriſhed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Propheſies in this Book. The occaſion of the firſt doubting of the Divine Authority of this Book: Hence roſe, in that it favoured the pretended Hereſie of the <hi>Chyliaſts</hi> or <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and their adverſaries endeavoured to father it rather on <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, then the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> thereby, if poſſibly they might, not only enervate its Teſtimony, but quite ſhut it out for ever out of the number of the Canonical Books of God, that it might never do the <hi>Chyliaſts</hi> any ſervice more. Vpon this ground <hi>Hyrome</hi> was the firſt that did moſt publiquely call its authority into queſtion, about the year of Chriſt 400. and that in pure oppoſition unto the Millenaries, the followers of <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Ireneus, Lactantius,</hi> and others of good credit and authority in the Church of Chriſt in that judgement. Secondly it became ſuſpected, as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> witneſſeth, (who in this particular, and concerning other Divine Books alſo, was very unſtable in his own Judgment) in that ſome of the ancient Greek primitive Chriſtians did not receive the <hi>Revelations</hi> as of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and this <hi>Hierome</hi> himſelf alſo teſtifies: But on what ſlender grounds this came to paſs, I ſhall preſently conſider: And though it is granted that ſome ancient Greek Chriſtians did not receive it, yet it was by others of the ſame age, and of the far abler parts, judgement, and integrity, numbred amongſt the Books of God, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have the publique ſtamp of his Spirit on it. There was one <hi>Caius</hi> or <hi>Gaius,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſſeth in the fourth book of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, who ſaith, That this Book was written of one <hi>Cerinthus</hi> an Heretique, who held among many other errors, That after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, his Kingdom ſhould become earthly and ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, wherein the fleſh ſhould be ſatisfied again in all manner of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcences, for the term of a compleat millenary of years. <hi>Dioniſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> takes up this report from this <hi>Caius</hi> an obſcure perſon, and (as is thought) was one of the heretical <hi>Alogi,</hi> who denied (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teſtifies) the Word of God; and on the falſe report of this <hi>Caius, Dioniſius</hi> doubts of the Divine Authority of this Book: But <hi>Hierome</hi> takes up the ſame ſlender ground from <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> and doth object it ſtrongly. But I anſwer, it ſeems <hi>Hierome</hi> would admit of any ſlender teſtimony to the invalidating of the Authority of this Book, becauſe this book was the great Fortreſs of his adverſaries the <hi>Chiliaſts:</hi> yet however, though <hi>Hierome,</hi> and ſome others of ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed credit, and of obſcure note, as <hi>Dorotheus, Dioniſius, Euſebius, Caius,</hi> do oppugne it, yet <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was ſo paſſionate friend to it, that he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53073:23"/>
reckons them among Heretiques that did reject it; and <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> and <hi>Ireneus</hi> of ſounder judgement, and of ſingular piety, did not only approve this book as canonical, but wrote commentaries on it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatſoever that <hi>Caius</hi> was that fathers the Apocalyps on <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> on whoſe report all his followers were miſled, yet the relation it ſelf holds not any reſemblance of truth; for <hi>Ireneus, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who write very largely of the hereſies of <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and his ſucceſſors, yet never mentions that he held this opinion of <hi>Chiliaſme,</hi> or the Kingdom of Chriſt on earth, which they could not be ignorant of; therefore this ſtory of <hi>Caius,</hi> concerning him and his Apocalyps, is Apocryphal, and a meer figment, on purpoſe deviſed by the adverſary, to leſſen the authority of this book; ſee more at large hereof in D. <hi>Homes, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Further, if <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was the Author of this book, doubtleſs he would have beſprinkled it with ſome other of his errors that were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to him; as that of the creation of the world by Angels, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Divinity of Chriſt, and affirming his generation to be only of the ſeed of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> as is teſtified by M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s book of Infidelity, treating of the hereſies of <hi>Cerinthus, Carpocrates,</hi> and their followers, <hi>page</hi> 129. &amp;c. But in this book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> there is not one word to this purpoſe, but rather the contrary ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed in many places thereof, as the ſubſequent diſcourſe thereon will manifeſt. And laſtly, If it were granted that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> held and expected a riotous and luxuriant Millenary, (which is now diſproved) yet this of the Apocalyps hath not the leaſt intimation thereof, but of a Millenary of reſt and joy, in a higher, and more ſpiritual key then ever the Church enjoyed on earth heretofore: there is great difference between an earthly ſenſual reigne, and to reigne on earth: Saints may be on earth, and yet be moſt ſpiritual; ſo they may have a Kingdom here on earth, and yet a moſt ſpiritualized and heavenly one, which is fully confirmed in the 21, and 22 chapters of this book. And ſo I have anſwered the firſt ground of ſuſpecting the divine authority of this Apocalyps.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Hierome</hi> the great Antagoniſt of this book writeth, that many learned men ſpake very ſharply againſt this book, and the whole matter thereof, as not becoming the gravity of an Apoſtle, being only a common hiſtory of things ſhaddowed under dark figures, and hard kind of ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Rather it becomes and ſavours the excellency and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of an Apoſtle, being directed to the then ſeven famous Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> carrying in it all along the ſpirit of Propheſie, and the very ſteps, ſentences, and figures of the old Prophets, being full of pregnant teſtimonies of the Divinity of Chriſt, and of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the work of our Redemption and Salvation by his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Interceſſion, and providential acts of gubernation of his Church to the end of the world. I confeſs the book in the figures and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereof is dark and myſterious, but that is not ſtrange in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical writings, as in <hi>Daniel, Ezekiel,</hi> &amp;c. It ſeemed good to God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53073:24"/>
to ſet us on diligence to enquire into the dealings of God with his Church and people, and not to over-ſlip the judgements of Gods providence, which are reſerved in God's infinite wiſdom unto their appointed times of diſcovery; that from generation to generation, his people and Church may be comforted and ſupported unto the end of all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Dioniſius</hi> aforeſaid, Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> reaſons very ſlightly againſt the divine authority of this book, when he ſaith, That <hi>it doth not ſuit with the gravity of an Apoſtle, to caſt up ſo oft his own name; ſince in his Goſpel he never nameth himſelf, but only pointeth it out by ſome modeſt marks as theſe;</hi> The Diſciple whom Jeſus loved: <hi>But here in this Book, in his Viſions and Conferences with the Angel, he hath never done with theſe kind of words,</hi> I John. This reaſon moved <hi>Dioniſius</hi> to think that this book was rather ſet out by ſome other in his name, then by himſelf.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, This oppoſition is but weak; for he that writes a Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or matters of Doctrine, as the Goſpel is mixed of both, he need not often inſert his own name; for the truth of that depends on its preſent verity, and other apparent circumſtances, witneſſed unto by the ſpirit of God in miracles, and its operations on the hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: But it is far otherwiſe with the Writers of Propheſie; for that receives authority by the Author, who is known to be a Prophet; for in every Propheſie that foretelleth things to come, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, firſt who revealed it; and then, to whom it was revealed; that the perſon being known to be a Prophet, and to have divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, we may give credit to it: for otherwiſe, who would give credence or faith to any of the Prophetical predictions, or books of the Prophets, before they ſaw them accompliſhed and fulfilled? As to inſtance in the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who maketh mention of his name at leaſt a hundred times; and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> how oft doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat theſe words, <hi>Iſaiah the ſon of Amos?</hi> And in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, we ſhall find his name more then threeſcore times repeated; yea, ye ſhall find <hi>I Daniel,</hi> about nine times from the ſeventh to the tenth chapter; and <hi>Paul</hi> when his Apoſtleſhip was called in queſtion by ſome falſe Brethren, and to ſhew the excellency of his Miniſtry, how often ſhall you read <hi>I Paul an Apoſtle</hi> (not of men, nor by men, but) of Jeſus Chriſt? And why ſhould it be accounted ſtrange, when <hi>John</hi> mentions not his name above five times in this whole book, and with that modeſty, that none might doubt of the truth of this Propheſie.</p>
               <p>Having wiped off the objections that have caſt jealouſies and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions on theſe divine Revelations, I ſhall in the next place endeavour to clear the divine authority thereof, and add ſome teſtimonies for that end; and I doubt not, but that being cleared, there is no true chriſtians but will receive this Book of Propheſies, but as the Oracles of God. The teſtimonies are of two ſorts, either from without, or ſecondly, within the ſaid book. Thoſe from without, are the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent of the churches of Chriſt in all ages, (excepting in the heat of conteſt, amongſt ſome violent perſons) to the receiving of them, into the Canon: The Councels of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the third Councel
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53073:24"/>
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and the Councel of <hi>Toletan</hi> 5. cap. 16. decreed it to be received as holy and divine Scriptures. Secondly, it was ſo received by moſt of the ancient Orthodox Fathers, as <hi>Justin Martyr, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Cyril, Epiphanius, Lactantius, Ireneus, Auguſtine,</hi> and many others; and ſo this book is often quoted by them, as of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their writings: I ſhall add the teſtimony of our late Aſſembly of Divines, in their confeſſion of Faith, ſet forth in the year of Chriſt, 1651. who do number this of the Revelation in the catalogue of the ſacred books of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are other teſtimonies very radiant and pregnant within the ſaid Book, to prove it of divine inſpiration: Firſt, In that it proceeded from ſo highly illuminated a perſon as <hi>John</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, the beloved Diſciple of Chriſt was, (which hereafter I ſhall evince) and being directed to the ſeven famous Aſian Churches, and being by them left unto all churches unto the end of the world, as the laſt publique Legacy of the ſpirit of God in this kind, muſt needs be from the ſpecial impulſe of the ſpirit of God: ſeeing God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer ſuch a palpable deceit to be put upon the churches, and to continue ſo long without controul, and under his own name, ſo often reiterated in thoſe Propheſies, if it were not from God himſelf, and by his Spirits direction, approbation, and providential preſervation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is clear and evident that this book is from the ſpirit of God, in that it doth fully harmonize and agree with the other indubitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived books of God, that treat about the divinity of Chriſt, and the work of our redemption.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, Seeing thoſe things are evidently come to paſs that this book of Propheſies hath predicted and foretold, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſeven Churches of Aſia, the dethroning of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, the riſe, continuance, and the fall of the Kingdom of the Beaſt, and of the Whore riding upon the Beaſt, &amp;c. with divers other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and contemporaries with the former; ſome whereof are long ſince evidently accompliſhed, and the reſt to be expected in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined times and periods; and to be ſure that this is an infallible mark of a Propheſie coming from God, when we ſee it come to paſs, conſult <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.21, 22, verſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I proceed to the ſecond Queſtion, about the Title of this book, (having cleared and confirmed the divine authority thereof) to wit, who is the Author thereof? Whether this <hi>John</hi> the Divine, be <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle and Evangeliſt, or ſome other perſon? Firſt, They that oppoſe the firſt, do offer as their reaſons, the unlikelyneſs of the ſtyle and ſpeech that there is between this book and the Goſpel of <hi>John,</hi> and his Epiſtles; which two latter agree in ſtyle, and many points of doctrine, but this of the Revelation is very diſſonant from them both. To which I anſwer, It is no marvel in the firſt two, of the Goſpel and his Epiſtles, though he writ by the inſtinct of the ſpirit of God, as unto the ſubſtantial Truths contained therein, yet he was not ſo ſtrict tyed up in the hiſtory of the Goſpel, or in the doctrines thereof, and the Epiſtles, but was left at large by the Spirit, to follow his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which he wrote according to his own genius and temper,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53073:25"/>
being high and ſublimate; but here in this book he muſt write thoſe things which he had heard and ſeen, and were delivered unto him: beſides, the Spirit in this Propheſie keeps ſomwhat the like and the ſame manner of expreſſions, characters, and method, as it did of old in the Prophets <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Iſaiah,</hi> and others; that it might appear that the ſame ſpirit of Propheſie did joyntly run through them all, and were endited by one and the ſame Spirit: ſo that this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does not at all hinder, but that it may be <hi>Johns,</hi> the Evangeliſt and Apoſtle, notwithſtanding the difference of the ſtyle in this of the Apocalyps, and others of <hi>John</hi>'s writings,</p>
               <p>Secondly, They that oppoſe, give as another reaſon (but unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly) that in all the Greek copies, the Revelation was entituled not unto <hi>John</hi> Evangeliſt, or <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, but unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. This rather proves the contrary; for indeed I ſhould deſire no better argument to prove it to be <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt's: for all the Learned know, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was by excellency, and as it were by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar prerogative, called by this name of the Divine, becauſe it was as it were his peculiar office and work in his Goſpel, to write and maintain the Divinity of Chriſt againſt thoſe Heretiques that oppoſed it in his time, as the <hi>Ebonites, Simon Magus, Carpocrates, Cerinthus,</hi> and their followers: Yet withal, I muſt needs ſay, that this word, <hi>The Divine,</hi> in our language, is too narrow a word or expreſſion for this Title <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which in the Greek is of more copious and extenſive ſignification, which makes much that it was the Evangeliſt that wrote this book for the foreſaid reaſon; becauſe he was the great aſſerter and maintainer of <gap reason="foreign">

the <hi>Divine;</hi> Or laſtly, He acquired that peculiar Title to himſelf, from the high Divine Inſpirations, and moſt eminent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries he had from God, beyond any others of Chriſts Diſciples in thoſe his Viſions; and ſo being very frequently and eminently converſant with God, he might juſtly acquire unto himſelf the Title of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
of <hi>John the Divine;</hi> but I rather think the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was the more genuine reaſon and ground of that Title.</p>
               <p>In the next place in the affirmative, I ſhall endeavour to confirm, that this <hi>John,</hi> who is the ſubordinate Author of the Apocalyps, is <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt and Apoſtle: To this purpoſe, conſider what is written <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 9. when <hi>Iohn</hi> was in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> under baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affliction, for the teſtimony of Jeſus, and the Word of God; that then he received his Revelations: which doth agree with all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and ancient Fathers, who all teſtifie with one conſent, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeliſt and Apoſtle was there baniſhed. And ſecondly, as a teſtimony from the beſt Antiquity (as <hi>Aretas</hi> witneſſeth) <hi>Baſil, Gregory, Cyril, Epiphanius, Ireneus, Hippolite,</hi> and moſt of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient orthodox Councels, plainly avouched this of the Revelation to be <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle's. This <hi>Iohn</hi> then, the Author of this book, was the ſon of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> the brother of <hi>Iames</hi> Major, or the great, and the Kinſman of our Lord's, and his beloved Diſciple, who was alwaies one of the three great witneſſes with Chriſt in his moſt retired and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53073:25"/>
eminenteſt actions and miracles of his whole life; who after Chriſt had accompliſhed the work of our Redemption on the croſs, and was aſcended, he followed the work of his Apoſtleſhip; and as Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Church hiſtory teſtifieth, having with the reſt of the Diſciples after Chriſt's aſcenſion, received power from on high, and the gift of the holy Ghoſt, his Province fell in the leſſer Aſia, for the work of his Miniſtery; where it is very probable, that he not only preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, converted, and founded thoſe ſeveral Churches, mentioned in the beginning of the Revelation, in the Cities of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Philadelphia, Sardis,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea;</hi> but alſo it ſeemeth evident that he appointed Paſtors, and Elders, and other Officers over thoſe churches, by his Apoſtolical authority; as <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles had done in their reſpective Provinces: and this is ſomwhat clear, in that he received from God thoſe ſeveral preadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments wich he is commanded to write, and to deliver to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of thoſe churches, as unto his peculiar charge and children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of him in the Lord, who in the time of the Emperour <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> about the year of Chriſt 84. wherein fell the ſecond great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt the Chriſtians, <hi>Iohn</hi> was forced and baniſhed from his church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to <hi>Pathmos,</hi> a Mediterranean Iſland, and one of thoſe called <hi>Cyclades,</hi> wherein he himſelf teſtifies, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 9. that he received his Revelation during the time of his baniſhment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I conceive the Title of this book, <hi>The Revelation of Iohn the Divine,</hi> to be a ſuperadded Title, and not <hi>Iohn</hi>'s own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet of great antiquity, given it by ſome primitive well-meaning chriſtians. My reaſons for this opinion is, that the Title <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Divine, was not peculiar to <hi>Iohn,</hi> more then the reſt of the Apoſtles, at the time of his writing the Revelation, it being written ſome years before his Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but his Goſpel was written after his return from baniſhment, as <hi>Euſebius, Prideaux</hi> hiſtory, <hi>pag</hi> 27. and other Eccleſiaſtique writers teſtifie: and for writing ſo divinely of the Word (which was God) in his Goſpel, as is declared, he juſtly acquired the Title of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Divine, and not for the Revelations, which was written before it. Another reaſon that juſtifies this opinion, is, that the firſt verſe in the firſt chapter looks as <hi>Iohn</hi>'s own Title, written by himſelf, to wit, <hi>The Revelation of Ieſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and which was ſignified by his Angel unto his ſervant Iohn:</hi> Wherein he only modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nominates himſelf by the Title of Chriſt's ſervant, <hi>Iohn;</hi> and without any other eminent ſuperadded Title, as <hi>Iohn the Divine:</hi> which hath ſwayed my reaſon, that that firſt Title was given unto him for honours ſake, and not took up by him himſelf.</p>
               <p>Having done with the authority, and alſo with the Author of this book, I come to the third thing propoſed to be conſidered, to wit, the ſcope, matter, and deſigne of the whole book, which I ſhall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle but compendiouſly, and more general, that I may not preoccupy my ſubſequent diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>This book of the Revelation is a book of Propheſies, wherein is a diſcovery of all ſuch notable events and alterations, as ſhould happen to the church of Chriſt, and her enemies, from her firſt riſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53073:26"/>
unto the end of all, ſet out and deſcribed in Hyerogliphique and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical viſions, which Chriſt hath ſignified unto his ſervant <hi>Iohn:</hi> and it containeth in it two general parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An admonitory Epiſtle, which is directed to the ſeven Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Aſia</hi> minor, which is the ſubject of the three firſt chapters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A general diſcourſe of all the alterations which generally do concern or relate to the church of Chriſt, from <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day, which is compriſed from the fourth chapter to the end of the book.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the Epiſtle there is to be taken notice, as in the preface there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, firſt the immediate Author from whom this admonition comes, and the whole of the Revelation, and that is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1. 1. and 11.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To whom it was given and delivered, and that was <hi>Iohn,</hi> verſ. 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To whom it was ſent and directed, and that was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira,</hi> to <hi>Sardis, Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> cap. 1. v. 11. and cap. 2. &amp; 3. throughout.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In this monitory Epiſtle is to be conſidered, what faults and errors they are admoniſhed and reproved of.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The threats laid out againſt them for non-amendment.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, The approbation of their well-doings, and of their faith, with an exhortation unto perſeverance therein.</p>

                  </gap>. In the ſecond general part or diſcourſe concerning the great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations that happens to the church of Chriſt, and its adverſaries: theſe moſt remarkable things, offer themſelves to the obſervant eye,</p>
               <p n="1">1. An hiſtorical relation under the viſions of ſeven ſealed books. or ſealed propheſies, in the 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 chapters, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally concern the various ſucceſſes, combuſtions, confuſions, and ruine of the heatheniſh Roman Empire; and in the middeſt of their higheſt confuſions, yet take notice of the providential preſervation of the church of Chriſt under it hotteſt perſecutions; and though migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily conſpiring its ruine, yet preſerved, fenced, and ſealed by God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In part of the eighth, and in the whole ninth chapter, under the viſions of the ſeven Trumpets, there is an alarum ſounded forth to the ruine of the then degenerated Roman Chriſtian Empire, by a ſeven-fold order of plagues; the four firſt being not ſo terrible as the three laſt, being entituled the three Wo-Trumpets.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You may obſerve, as it were, a digreſſion in the propheſie, after the plague of the ſixt (being the ſecond wo-Trumpet) was poured out in the ninth chapter, and the deſcription of the ſeventh and laſt Wo-Trumpet ſet off to another place, where the wiſdom of the Spirit found it more conveniently to refer it; and in the tenth chapter, to fall upon the propheſie of the little book, which is as a preface and entrance unto the propheſie and diſcovery of the events and deſtinies that ſhould befal to Chriſt's church until the end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the eleventh chapter, you may obſerve how therein there is a peculiar viſible and full diſcovery of the ſtate and progreſs of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53073:26"/>
church of God, even from the time of this propheſie, unto the later day, and you may farther obſerve, that this viſion of the open book, which principally relate to the church of Chriſt in this eleventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do moſt neceſſarily concur and connex with all other the viſions and propheſies of the Revelation, concerning the ſecular powers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Seals and Trumpets; for both do concur together, though under ſeveral characters and viſions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the twelfth chapter, there is as it were a retrogranation to a more particular, ample, and fuller diſcovery of the perſecuted and afflicted ſtate of the church of Chriſt, under the Kingdom of the grear red Dragon, concurring with the propheſie of the ſix Seals under the idolatrous heatheniſh Roman Empire, until ſhe had brought forth her man-childe, and the Dragon caſt down and deſtroyed; yet ſhe was not ſo freed from her afflicted ſtate, but ſhe was glad to fly into the wilderneſs, where the Dragon ſends his floods after her of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, beſides errors and hereſies, to overwhelm her if he could.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You may obſerve in the viſions of the thirteenth chapter, the Dragon being dethroned, how he ſubſtitutes in his room the ten horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beaſt, the ſecular Roman Empire divided into ten Kingdoms, which perſecutes the woman being entred into the wilderneſs, and does the work of the Dragon, and of the former heatheniſh Empire againſt her. Yet that's not all, there is another two horned Beaſt joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raging and reigning with the former, at one and the ſame time, which doth as much miſchief to her as that ſecular Beaſt it ſelf doth, being the Eccleſiaſtique and Pſeudo-prophetical Beaſt, or Antichriſt it ſelf, who is the former Beaſts great chaplain, Prophet, and Vicar general; who under pretence of Chriſt, and Chriſtian Religion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two horns like a Lamb, yet exerciſes the cruelty of the Dragon, and ſets up again other under ſpecious titles, the late aboliſhed heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Idolatry, and tyrannous perſecuting Government, like that of the Dragons, and ſo healeth the wound given to the firſt Beaſt. This Beaſt's tokens, qualities, and characters are herein deſcribed, that they that have wiſdom, may know and ſhun them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the fourteenth chapter is obſervable, how during the reigne of this antichriſtian beaſt, the faithful followers of the Lamb, by their continual publiſhing of the ſincere Goſpel of Chriſt, they bring ruine and deſolation upon ſpiritual or myſtical Babylon, the antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſtate and ſeat, ſet forth under the cry of the three Angels, but more particularly in the 15 and 16 chapters, in the viſions of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and the effuſions thereof, are the particular, gradual, and final ruines of the anti-chriſtian Beaſt, with all the churches enemies, more fully ſet forth and manifeſted; at the pouring out whereof, the church of Chriſt being freed and delivered from all anti-chriſts oppreſſions, and idolatrous pollutions, ſhe ſings her tryumphant ſong, the ſong of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. In the ſeventeenth chapter, that thoſe precedent prophetical Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Diſcoveries may not ſeem improbable, the Spirit it ſelf gives the interpretation of the myſtery of the great whore of Babylon, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a ſcarlet coloured beaſt of ſeven heads, and ten horns. The
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53073:27"/>
Beaſt is the Roman Empire, divided under ten Kings, or Kingdoms. The woman harlot is the great City, to wit, <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf (which the Jeſuites themſelves cannot deny, as in the preface hereof is more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted) which reigneth over the Kings of the earth, the mother City of all ſpiritual fornications: By this taſte of the Spirit's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, it plainly appears, that the whole Book of Viſions are to be applyed and explained hiſtorically, and that every myſterie opens others to the diſcovery, even of the whole.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In the 18 and 19 chapters is but a more ſolemn reiterating of the execution of Gods wrath againſt the antichriſtian ſtate, with the horror, anguiſh, and utter deſolations that ſhould befal it, and all the Churches combined enemies; whereupon the Church being now freed from all dangers, gives praiſe, power, and glory unto God: And in chap. 20. enjoys that happy ſabbath of reſt, that glorious reigne on earth for a thouſand years; that great day of judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the firſt reſurrection, and determined with the laſt and univerſal reſurrection of all the dead, when all Chriſts enemies ſhall be taken and caſt into hell, to be tormented for evermore; and the Saints tranſlated into the glorified eſtate, that heavenly City, the new Jeruſalem, the ſpouſe of Chriſt, which came down from heaven to reigne with him for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In 21 and 22 chapters, you may obſerve the glorious deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of this new glorified Church-ſtate, which came down from heaven, ſet forth by moſt excellent metaphors and figures, wherein all ſpiritual delicacies, in a far higher pitch then the church ever yet enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on earth, ſet forth unto us by ſuch reſemblances &amp; figures, as is now moſt glorious to our capacities, and fitteſt to expreſs ſuch heavenly and ſpiritual matters; whereupon follows a concluſion of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of that glory, but never of the glory it ſelf, and ſo of the whole propheſie, with a confirmation of the verity and truth thereof, until the accompliſhment of all.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being cleared and premiſed, and having laid down a brief view of the ſcope and deſigne of the whole, I come, by Gods aſſiſtance, and with a ſpirit of ſobriety, and with awe and reverence, to open in the next place the myſteries of the book it ſelf.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53073:28"/>
and paſſages which muſt ſhortly come to paſs, verſe 3. And how with reaſon could a bleſſing be promiſed to the keeping of the words of this Propheſie, if it were not known what was to be read, heard, and kept? We have further the teſtimony of the Spirit for it, cap. 10. v 8. That the little book was an open book, wherein is contained the great revolutions of the Church, until the end of all; and in chap. 22. v. 10. there is a poſitive command not to ſeal the propheſies of this book, for the time is at hand.</p>

He is the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world; the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever: He was the Angel of the Covenant, and the keeper of Iſrael of old, and is the ſame to us for ever: It was he that bruiſed the Serpents head in the beginning, upon our parents firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and it is he that is more then conqueror over all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſs, now, and for ever. He was the ſame ſpiritual rock and way of ſalvation to the Patriarchs of old, as he is now unto us, and none ever did or ſhall come to the father, or receive good from him, but in, by, and thorow the Son, who is the true light, that lightneth every one that cometh into the world; ſo that if Chriſt be yours, then all is yours, whether things preſent, or things to come, for Chriſt is God's. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. Laſtly, he is the high Steward, and great Diſpenſer in God's Kingdom; All power is given unto him in heaven and in earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. That that Propheſie which comes from ſo ſure an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor as Jeſus Chriſt, muſt infallibly be true, and come to paſs: for he is, and always was the great Prophet of his Church; it was he that gave viſions and Propheſies to the Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah, Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, Ezekiel, Daniel;</hi> ſomtimes by his miniſtring ſpirits, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; ſomtime by himſelf, in the appearance of the likeneſs of the ſon of man, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. v. 26. And all know, that their prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſtood ſure, and were accompliſhed in their reſpective ſeaſons: But as unto the ſtedfaſtneſs and faithfulneſs of this book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, ſee what Chriſt himſelf teſtifies in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. &amp; 14. and in ch. <hi>ult. v.</hi> 6. <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Son of God, who is the faithful and true witneſs;</hi> therefore of moſt ſure performance in God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeaſons.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt's ſervants are very privie to Gods counſels, and knows much of his deſignes. This Chriſt hath verified, Firſt, From that ground of union which is between Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for being once become his members or ſervants, then they in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them; and according to that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. <hi>They have an unction from him that is holy, and they know all things;</hi> ſo that they that have the Son, have the Father alſo; for they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53073:28"/>
both are one in will, counſel, power, and eſſence, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22. And <hi>the ſecrets of the Lord are with thoſe that fear him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They know much of the mind of God in all the combuſtions, changes, and revolutions of this world. Many think that they come by chance, ill fortune, or for want of foreſight in manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of State affairs; but the ſervants of God know, that the hand of God is in all thoſe revolutions and State-ſhakings, and that there can no evil befal unto the City, but that there is the providence of God in it, directing and over-ruling it unto its end; ſo that they do foreſee, that this change, and that alteration in the world will come too, and can rightly conclude, that all tend (as in a chain of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences) to bring about God's great end, in the exaltation of Chriſt's Throne, and the pulling down his enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. God reſerved the more full revelation of all things concerning the changes and revolutions of the Church and State, and the end of all, unto the day of Chriſts exaltation in glory. Chriſt on earth, was not ſo glorious as Chriſt in heaven; he had not ſo full commiſſion to ſend out ſo much of his Spirit while he was on earth, as when he was in heaven, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. So in like manner, it is no ſin to ſay, that God had not communicated unto Chriſt's manhood, whiles here on earth, the compleat knowledge of times and ſeaſons, and the end of all; for he is ſaid <hi>to grow in knowledge;</hi> and therefore according to his manhood, whiles here on earth, might be ignorant in ſome things: But yet it is clear, the Father revealed it to him when he aſcended into heaven, that he might reveal it to his Church, as the due reward of all his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Thou art worthy to take the Book, and open the Seals thereof, for thou wast ſlain, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>From theſe words you may obſerve, That God reveals theſe Propheſies, not immediately from himſelf, but mediately, and by inſtruments.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God gives this Revelation to Chriſt, Chriſt gives diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, partly himſelf, and partly gives commiſſion to his Angels for the ſame. Thirdly, The Angels inſtruct <hi>John.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>John</hi> directeth the ſame to the ſeven Churches. And fifthly, From the ſeven Churches, they are left to all the Churches of Chriſt, for information, unto the end of the world. The infinity of God, and the finiteneſs of creatures are not compatible, therefore God uſes inſtruments ſutable to our capacities, for diſcovery of his mind.</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. From the Meſſenger or Angel, by whom partly this propheſie was ſent, Obſerve, That Chriſt employs Angels in great ſervices for his Church. Angels were the firſt publiſhers and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Chriſts birth, an Angel tells the Apoſtles that Chriſt ſhould return in that manner they had ſeen him go up to heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. Angels tells <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> what God would do to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53073:29"/>
Chriſt tells <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 22.16. That he ſent his Angels to teſtifie thoſe things in the Churches. The Angels are made mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits for the ſervice of the church, and their ſervice is more manifeſt in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They inform us of God's will, and God of our ways; they aſcend and deſcend, <hi>Zac.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</p>

                  <p>From the perſon to whom this propheſie was ſent, and revealed by the Angel, under this relation of his ſervant <hi>John;</hi> what this <hi>Iohn</hi> was, is made fully to appear in the preliminary diſcourſe unto the Title, it was <hi>Iohn</hi> the brother of <hi>Iames,</hi> our Lord's kinſman, the beloved diſciple, a great Pillar and Apoſtle in the Church of Chriſt, and yet he is here deſcribed under the title and relation of ſervant, not only ſo by right of creation, but of redemption, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial right, covenant, and ſervice.</p>
                  <p>From which obſerve, That to be related to Chriſt by way of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is a higher priviledge then any outward relation to him. Better be Chriſt's bondman, then his kinſman; inward priviledges are more honourable then carnal; <hi>Mary</hi> was happier in carrying Chriſt in her heart, then in her womb. <hi>Iohn</hi> glories more to be Chriſt's ſervant then his coſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.47, 48, &amp;c. Chriſt profeſſeth, that they are his kindred, who ſhall do the will of his father: and he that is related to Chriſt in grace and faith, is as ſure of his love and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, as any of his neareſt friends or kinſmen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. It is man's greateſt honour to be Chriſt's ſervant. It was a curſe upon <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 9. to be a ſervant of ſervants; but to be Chriſt's ſervant, is not only free, but noble: <hi>Iohn,</hi> though he was a great pillar, a prophetical Apoſtle, the darling Diſciple, yet Chriſt calls him but his ſervant: <hi>Paul,</hi> though he were the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, and ſo calls himſelf, and glories in the priviledge, and that he was an Hebrew of the Hebrews, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5. that is, born of the ancient Hebrew race and linage, and one migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Law, brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> yet how often doth <hi>Paul</hi> inculcate in his Epiſtles, <hi>Paul the ſervant of Ieſus Chriſt? Rom.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>&amp;c. Tit.</hi> 1.1. <hi>&amp;c. David,</hi> a King, ſhould rather glory to be a ſervant unto God, and a door-keeper in his houſe, then to live in the courts of Princes.</p>

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53073:29"/>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. If the higheſt in repute and office in Chriſt's church be but ſervants, then not lords; the grave Apoſtles, <hi>Paul, James, John,</hi> are but ſervants, and would be accounted but as the Miniſters of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. and not as lords and maſters over the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. Chriſt alone is the great Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Impoſer of Tyes and Rules upon the conſcience of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.13. The greateſt Apoſtle, Biſhop, Paſtor, or Elder, deſerves but the honour of a Servant, Miniſter, or Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard in the church, not of a Lord and Maſter; their work is a work of ſervice, to perſwade, entreat, convince by reaſons, not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, dictate, and compel: In ſhort, they can impoſe nothing as neceſſary to be believed, done, and practiſed, which is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mind of God; and that, neither in their own name, or for their own ends; for they are ſervants, not at their own diſpoſe, but at the call, beck, and direction of another, even of their Lord and Maſter, Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo ſomwhat to be conſidered in that, when Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ſets down, and takes notice by name to whom he gives this Propheſie, <hi>His ſervant John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence note, 1. That the truth of a Propheſie depends much for credit, on the credit and reputation of the Relator. <hi>John</hi> was Chriſt's beloved Diſciple, moſt highly illuminated in the myſteries of the Eternal Word of God, <hi>John</hi> was a Prophet, and the laſt that had prophetical Viſions, to a full diſcovery of the ſtate of things to the end of the world, and therefore there is an Anathema gone forth againſt all perſons that ſhall add or diminiſh from the words of this propheſie, in the 18 and 19 verſes of chap. 22. for there is no other diſcovery of the ſtate of affairs, then what is in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent book, to be expected until the end of all; and therefore the Spirit of God, in the ſecond verſe, the better to gain belief and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto the Truth of this propheſie, and unto the ſubordinate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and Author thereof, deſcribes his Excellencies, Offices, Gifts, and Qualities, in theſe words.</p>

Or ſecondly, Whether this Record of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53073:30"/>
Word of God, and the Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the things which he ſaw, be to be underſtood of the Truth of the Word of God in this book of Propheſies, which Jeſus Chriſt did teſtifie unto, and was made apparent by Viſions unto <hi>John.</hi> Indeed I ſhall willingly admit of both ſenſes; and I am of opinion, the Spirit of God in this verſe aims at both, for adding the better authority and credit to the truth of this book of Propheſies; and though the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of <hi>Iohn</hi> was not written when this Revelation was given, yet by his conſtant preaching, he might well be ſeen to bear Record of the Word of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, and of all things that he ſaw.</p>

If the diſcovery of this Propheſie were not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, how vain would it be to promiſe bleſſedneſs to the diligent obſervers thereof? I conceive it would be very derogatory to the Divine Truth of God, to make ſuch a ſuppoſition.

How ſingular uſeful it is to foreſee the coming either of the day of joy and tryumph, or the day of evil and affliction? That our Spirits may be born up, and our hearts comforted under all conditions, in the certain hopes and expectancy of the one, and that we may not murmure in the other, but acquieſce under the hand of God in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, until the day of the wrath of the Lord be paſt and over. This book of Propheſies is full of ſuch diſcoveries, to wit, The afflicted ſtate of the Church, its ſecurity in that condition, together with the riſe of Antichriſt, its reigne, pollutions, and a diſcovery thereof; and at laſt, its utter ruine and abolition; and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thereof; the Reſtauration of the Church to glory. Judicious chriſtians ſhould account this knowledge excellent, it will much help to keep their ſpirits in a frame and temper ſutable to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: This will teach them to know, that this is a time of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and tribulation, not of tryumphing and reigning. While the Bridegroom is abſent, the Spouſe is under ſorrow and mourning, not of mirth and rejoycing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Scarlet Whore, or harlot church ſits yet as a queen, and therefore the true Spouſe ſits mourning, yet ſtill expecting the day-ſtar to ariſe for her comfort and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

The work of judgements is as it were a work of abhorrency unto God; <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael! How often would I have gathered and healed you, but ye would not?</hi> It is God's method, a long time to exerciſe his patience and forbearance, before his wrath be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: he will try all means in the firſt place by mercies, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, by deliverances, to win a people to himſelf: he will (as a good husbandman) many years encloſe, dig, dreſs, and prune his

Vineyard, in expectancy of fruitfulneſs, before he will hew them down, and caſt them in the fire: He will abide long with his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding children; forty years long was he grieved by his gainſaying people Iſrael: yea, he will come down and ſee (as if formerly he did not take notice of their ſins, hoping of their amendment by ſuch forbearance) whether their tranſgreſſions be ſo or not, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not only the gifts and graces of the Spirit, but Grace it ſelf, the fountain and original of all good, even the good will, and free favour of God, which he bears to his Elect, even whilſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in and through Jeſus Chriſt: and Peace, which is not only happy ſucceſs from God in all things which concerns the felicity of our ſouls and bodies; but more eſpecially, reconciliation unto, and with God, from whence floweth all true peace and tranquility unto the mind and conſcience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How comes <hi>Iohn</hi> to wiſh Grace and Peace to the ſeven Churches, whilſt being churches of Chriſt, they had this Grace and Peace aforehand?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He wiſheth unto them a fuller ſenſe, and more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous fruits of this Grace and Peace, and perſeverance in it; it ſeems by their backſlidings, they had loſt ſome of the comforts and fruits of their grace, and therefore need a ſupply from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. I anſwer, All Grace is not given at once to God's beſt children, but by degrees, and as they are capable of; and therefore rightly might <hi>Iohn</hi> wiſh theſe Churches an encreaſe, and ſo may all Chriſt's Miniſters unto all, that will ever want encreaſe of grace whiles here beneath; for none here in this world will ever ſee perfection in an abſolute and abſtract ſenſe, and therefore will ſtill have need of an additament of grace and peace</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53073:32"/>You have here the Author or Fountain (to wit the Trinity) from which all happineſs, all true grace and peace do proceed, even from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; that is, from that almighty glorious God, who only hath an abſolute and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being, in, and of himſelf, who was from all eternity, and is the ſame for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And from the ſeven Spirits which are before his Throne,</hi>] Here is ſome difficulty in Interpretation, What is meant by the ſeven Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? Some interpret that here is meant ſeven principal miniſtring Spirits, or Angels, that always ſtand before the Throne of God, to receive his commands: But this I cannot approve of; Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe grace and peace is here deſired from them, joyntly, as from God and Jeſus Chriſt, to be beſtowed upon the Churches; and this is not the Angels, or creatures work, but only the Creator's.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For that in all the Epiſtles where there is mention made of this or the like ſalutation, you ſhall never find it in any created Spirits or Angels name, but only in this ſort; <hi>The love of the Father, the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, the conſolation or peace of the Spirit be with you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for that in chap. 5. v. 6. theſe ſeven Spirits are there called the ſeven eyes of the Lamb that was ſlain, which the Spirit ſent forth into the whole earth. Which reaſons do clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, that we muſt here in this place, and there alſo, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this ſpoken of the Spirit of God, which here goes under the denomination of ſeven Spirits, to ſignifie its ſeven-fold power, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, efficacy, and gifts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. For this myſtical number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, do always in this book, and all other propheſies, ſignifie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs and perfection; ſeven Churches, ſeven Candleſticks, ſeven Seals, ſeven Trumpets, ſeven Vials, ſeven Angels, all ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a perfection in their kinds.</p>
                  <p>Hence take this Note:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the Father, Son, and Spirit, the whole Trinity, are engaged for the ſupport and encreaſe of our grace and peace, and of all our joy, comfort, and happineſs, here, hereafter, and for ever. From the Father more peculiarly flows the grace of Election; from the Son, the grace of Redemption and Satisfaction; from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the grace of Sanctification, Peace, and Conſolation: And from the Three in one, our God bleſſed for ever, Salvation, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Glory.</p>

Firſt, In that he hath faithfully declared the Will of the Father. Secondly, In that he hath been faithful in all his works, about our Redemption, committed to him by the Father.

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That this Propheſie having ſo faithful an Author and Relater as Chriſt, it muſt ſurely be true, and come to paſs. If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, much more what was ſpoken by the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1, 2. ſee more hereon, cap. 3. 14.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt is here called the firſt-gotten of the dead; firſt, becauſe he was the firſt that roſe by his own proper power from the dead. Secondly, becauſe all that have riſen, or ſhall ſo riſe, does it by a derivative vertue and power from him. Thirdly, he may be called the firſt-born, or firſt fruits of the dead, becauſe he is the true and ſubſtantial firſt-fruits that was offered up unto God, for the living and the dead; which was typified in the Levitical primicies, or firſt fruits, or firſt-born, that was offered unto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.</p>

                     <hi>He cometh with Clouds,</hi>] This is a Graeciſm; that is, In the Clouds. This verſe hath an Index, or an Aſteriſme before it:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53073:33"/>
                     <hi>Behold,</hi> to ſhow, that it is very remarkable what is here expreſſed, being as the general propoſition unto the whole Revelation. Chriſts coming in the clouds in power and glory to ſet up his Kingdom here on earth before the ultimate judgement. This hath relation to <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> 12.10. and promiſed in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.64. <hi>and</hi> 24.30. and <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. &amp;c. Several Interpretations offer here to the conſideration: Some would have it here meant, that at the time of Chriſt's paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this Scripture was fulfilled in theſe firſt fruits of the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. that were the crucifyers of Chriſt, being pricked to the hearts becauſe of him, and of the evil by them done unto him, and ſo mourned over him. Though indeed it is granted that that propheſie in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. is partly fulfilled in that of the firſt fruits of the Jews converſion, who truly mourned for him whom they had pierced; <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.37. yet <hi>Iohn</hi> here in this propheſie, and in this verſe, long after Chriſt's aſcenſion, re-inforces, and takes up the ſame relation, to be fulfilled at Chriſt's ſecond coming in the clouds; therefore that of <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. was never compleatly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed to this day. Secondly, Theſe ſmall numbers of the firſt effuſion of the Spirit after Chriſt's paſſion, cannot with any ſound reaſon anſwer that general and univerſal mourning, promiſed of in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. where the ſeveral families of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Nathan,</hi> of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> of <hi>Simeon,</hi> &amp;c. and all the families that remain, ſhall all mourn apart, or joyntly, as they did at <hi>Hadimmon,</hi> in the valley of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That propheſie of <hi>Zachary</hi> 12. could not wholly relate to the time of Chriſt's paſſion, or little after, becauſe in the day of the fulfilling of that propheſie, he would make the Governour of Judy like an hearth of fire in the wood, and like a torch of fire in the ſheaf, and they ſhall devour all the people round about, and the Lord ſhall ſave the Tents of Judah, &amp;c. ver. 6, 7. and that in ver. 8, and 9. God would in that day make the feeble of the houſe of Judah as <hi>David</hi> for ſtrength, and of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> as the Angel of God: and that God would in that day ſeek to deſtroy all that came againſt Jeruſalem. But in how contrary, low, and weak condition Ieruſalem and Iudah was in at the time about Chriſt's paſſion (being then under the Roman yoke) and ever ſince have been under a miſerable afflicted eſtate, as all hiſtories teſtifie: And how unſutable ſuch a condition is with the fulfilling of the aforeſaid propheſie, let the wiſe conſider. Therefore ſure this coming of Chriſt, muſt be intended of his ſecond coming, future to his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion; for he was aſcended long before this Revelation was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come, in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven. Acts</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p>Others again apply the time of this mourning and looking upon Chriſt whom they had pierced, wholly to be the time of the laſt and ultimate judgement of the wicked; when as they ſay, all they that crucified him, and all his enemies, ſhall mourn and wayl for anguiſh, and tremble before him. But this cannot be the whole or main ſenſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53073:33"/>
of the Spirit herein, nor altogether according to the time thereof, for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe this time or day of mourning, is not of mourning to deſperation, as that ultimate mourning of the wicked is, but it is a godly ſorrow or mourning that leadeth unto repentance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11. It is <hi>as one mourning for his only ſon,</hi> or <hi>as that mourning was for good Joſiah ſlain at Megiddo;</hi> out of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of love and compaſſion, not of horrour and deſperation, as the former is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another reaſon is, becauſe in this day of mourning, there is promiſed, that God would pour out the Spirit of Grace and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications upon the Inhabitants of Judah and Ieruſalem, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. unto which this verſe does relate; but in that day of God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting his laſt wrath on the wicked, is no time of pouring out of grace, nor the ſpirit of ſupplications; therefore to me it clearly follows, that ſeeing the Prophet <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. and <hi>John</hi> in this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verſe, both propheſie of one and the ſame perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and coming of Chriſt in the clouds, eſpecially intends the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Iews, of them that pierced him, and that before the ultimate judgement of all, for then there is no time of repentance or converſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third reaſon is from the words; <hi>And all the kindreds of the earth ſhall wail becauſe of him: Even ſo, Amen.</hi> If it were to be underſtood here only, that all the kindreds of the earth ſhould ſee Chriſt's coming, and wail for dread or horrour, as the wicked at the ultimate judgement day, then <hi>John</hi> would never ſet ſuch a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Amen to it, So it ſhall be; ſeeing himſelf, and all the Saints departed likewiſe, do expect and reſt in hope for the ſight of this his ſecond coming unto their joy and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the concluſion or obſervation that ariſes hence, and as a right Interpretation of this verſe, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That Chriſt will appear again in the clouds, to be ſeen of all, to the converſion of his ancient people the Iews, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all his enemies, and the reſtauration of all things, before the end of all.</p>
                  <p>And this concluſion and interpretation flows from theſe grounds or reaſons. Firſt, from the very genuine ſenſe of the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this verſe, <hi>Every eye ſhall ſee him gloriouſly coming in the clouds: As ye have ſeen him going, ſo ſhall ye ſee him come.</hi> Acts 1.9. We ſee him now by the eye of Faith in heaven, but then by the eye of the body. Faith and ſight are two diſtinct things; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. all do not now ſee him by faith, but then all and every eye ſhall ſee him coming in the clouds, to perform a double work; the one in a wonderful manner, to cauſe the Iews that pierced him, to look on him and mourn, even to a holy repentance; whoſe converſion will be ſo wonderful, that it wil be as a Nation born in one day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.8. And this is no more then was done formerly towards <hi>Paul,</hi> Chriſt miraculouſly appearing to his converſion, and which he intimates
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53073:34"/>
muſt likewiſe follow afterwards to Iſrael, in that that God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him this grace firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That all his obſtinate enemies may look upon him, and mourn and wail, even to deſperation; for that their ruine, and the day of God's great wrath is coming on them: for it is the work of Cnriſt's appearance, not only to deſtroy all his anti-chriſtian adverſaries, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. but alſo to the joy, comfort, and exaltation of his Church, 2 Pet. 5.4. Now this cannot be the work of the end of all, and ultimate judgement, becauſe this of Chriſt coming in the clouds here, is ſet as the general reſult, and the main propoſition of the whole of the Revelation; wherein the great deſigne is, to ſet forth Chriſt to come, and the glorious eſtate of his Church here on earth, before the ultimate end, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereafter: To demonſtrate this a little plainer, I ſet theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries out of <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. collated with this place, and that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.30.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Was ever Iudah or Ieruſalem ſince that Propheſie, made to her enemies a cup of trembling? Was ſhe ever a burdenſome ſtone to the whole earth, to cut them in pieces? Have ever the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Iudah been like an hearth of fire amongſt the wood, and and like a torch of fire in a ſheaf, devouring all the people round about? Or, Were they ever ſince that Propheſie of <hi>Zachary,</hi> in that ſtrength, that the feeble amongſt them were as <hi>David,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> as <hi>Elohim,</hi> &amp;c. Peruſe the Hiſtory of the Iews, and conſider whether you can find the leaſt accompliſhment thereof?</p>
                  <p>I next quere, when was ever that eminent effuſion of the Spirit of grace and ſupplication poured out on the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the inhabitants of Ieruſalem, that they ſhould look on him whom they had pierced, and mourn for him with great bitterneſs, each fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily mourning apart? Was this done at Chriſt's paſſion by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Iews his crucifiers? They derided him: Or was this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſmall number of the Iews, his Diſciples, the eleven, who fled at his ſuffering? They did not pierce him: Or was this fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon thoſe mourners in <hi>Acts</hi> 2? They ſaw him not when they mourned, nor with their families apart, nor ſaw him in the clouds, and thereupon mourn for him; and therefore as yet the main of this Propheſie is to be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Is this to be referred to the laſt reſurrection or ultimate judgement? I ask, Is that a day of repentance, of mourning, and of grace? That is a day of judgement unto the wicked, and then Chriſt's diſpenſatory Kingdom of Grace is at an end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. Therefore to be brief, and not to exceed due bounds, I aſſert, That here by ſeeing Chriſt coming in the clouds by every eye, and by them that pierced him, and that all kindreds of the earth ſhould wail becauſe of him, is meant by <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>Zachary</hi> meant, namely, that all the Tribes, both Iews and Gentiles, ſhould ſee Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the clouds with glory, as man, before the end of all: to the Iews, and all his Elect, with grace and godly repentance; to the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53073:34"/>
all other his enemies, with horrour and confuſion: conſult <hi>Jer</hi> 25.5, 6. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. throughout.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But here it may be objected, That you make divers comings of Chriſt to judgement, the one to the converſion of the Iews, and the reſtauration of his Church to a glorious State and Reigne, in the deſtruction of their enemies; and another, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming again, before the final end of all things, to execute the ultimate judgement. But this is contrary to Scripture, which mentions only of two comings of Chriſt; the firſt in the fleſh, in the time of the Goſpel; and the laſt at the day of judgement, to execute the wrath of his Father on all his impenitent enemies, and the refuſers of his Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Chriſt's coming in Scripture is variouſly taken; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for his firſt coming in the fleſh; ſomtimes in Spirit of grace, power, and miracles; but laſtly, and moſt eminently, to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And in this his laſt coming, there are ſeveral remarkable periods and events; In the beginning and morning of this great day, he comes to convert the Jews, reſtore the kingdom unto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and to the church of Chriſt, and to deſtroy antichriſt, and all the Saints enemies; not utterly, finally; but of all power and dominion over the Church, which is quite taken off by Chriſt; and a ſure chain or tye laid on their ſpirits of malice, and on their Ring-leader, Satan himſelf, that there is none can hurt during this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reigne in Gods holy mountain: This Reſtauration is the work of the morning of the day. But the wotk of the evening of this day, is, the univerſal reſurrection of the dead, and to give final ſentence on all the enemies of Chriſt, that oppoſed him, and his Kingdom, and to give them their portions with the divel and his angels, in that lake of fire that burneth for evermore: ſee more at large hereof in chap. 20. So that there is not two laſt comings of Chriſt, but two remarkable acts or events in this his laſt coming; to wit, in the morning and evening of this great day of his appearance.</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That all Chriſt's ſervants are brethren, and fellow-feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in all conditions, whether good or evil. And this flows from that root of union, being all baptized into one Spirit, and made members of one myſtical body: ſo that what good ſoever falls to any one of Chriſt's members, the whole body is partaker of the joy of it. When the loſt ſheep, or the loſt groat in the parable was found, there was a general rejoycing for it; <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith the good man) <hi>rejoyce with me, for I have found my loſt ſheep.</hi> If any evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal to any member, there is mutual mourning for it; for there is, as I may ſo ſay, the ſame ſtream of blood running in all their veins, being members of the ſame Body: Nay, and not only a ſympathy between the members, but alſo between their head, Chriſt and them; for he takes notice of all that is done unto them, as done unto himſelf, whether good or evil: <hi>In as much as ye have not done it unto one of theſe, ye have not done it unto me; but having done it unto one of theſe, you have done it unto me,</hi> Matth. 25.45. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms all in power, how dangerous it is to caſt contempt on the Saints of Chriſt; and much more to lay affliction on them.

Whenſoever tribulation or perſecution do ſeize on any of the eminenteſt lights or miniſters of God's churches, then be ſure the interiour chriſtians or members ſhall not go free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but be ſufferers alſo. The churches now in this time of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and tribulation, muſt not think to be greater or freer then their maſter's own flock was in the time of his abode on earth; for then according to that propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah, The Shepherd was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the flock were diſperſed, and fled:</hi> Therefore let all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not think to have a greater priviledge of exemption, when they are in the ſame condition that thoſe ſheep of his own calling was, in his time on earth.</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. As a corrolary from this note, That it is a raſh and dangerous thing, to judge of the condition of chriſtians according to their outward afflictions. <hi>John</hi> was here a man of tribulation, and under baniſhment, yet the beloved Diſciple of Chriſt. The world preſently judges thoſe are none of God's people, for they are afflicted, diſcountenanced, impriſoned, baniſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I could wiſh that none but the world did judge ſo: This is the way to condemn the righteous, and let the guilty go free: Of perſons of ſuch judgement, I demand; Was <hi>John</hi> that was in baniſhment, and under tribulation, or <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Courtiers in proſperity and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp, neareſt or deareſt unto God? Was <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Mordecai,</hi> and the three children in the Babyloniſh captivity, leſs righteous, or more ungodly then King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who at that time lived in ſtate and ſin in the land of Judah? Or was <hi>Jeconiah</hi> more beloved of God dwelling at Jeruſalem, who was a deſpiſed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Idol, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22.28. then thoſe dear children of God in Babylon, who waited under a long and hard captivity? Was not <hi>Paul</hi> with his fetters about his heels, dearer unto God then <hi>Agrippa</hi> with his crown on his head, ſitting in the Throne, to condemn him? Shall we number the Apoſtles, the Martyrs in the primitive times, and ſince, when they were impriſoned, ſtoned, ſawed aſunder, burnt, tormented, and ſlain, amongſt and in the catalogue of tranſgreſſors? Is not this to condemn Chriſt himſelf, who is made a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows for our ſakes? In ſhort, thoſe that are under great tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53073:36"/>
may be dear and beloved children of God, when thoſe that are in great proſperity, may be both hated, &amp; obſtinate enemies unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. Another obſervation hence is, That in the loweſt, and moſt afflicted condition of God's church and people, God makes out unto them the greateſt diſcoveries of himſelf, in light, and truth, and comfort. God here diſcovers unto <hi>Iohn</hi> under tribulation and baniſhment, this excellent book of Propheſies, for the comfort of his people unto the end of all. Unto the children of Iſrael when they were in a ſtrange land, and under captivity, and deprived of all their ordinances peculiar to their Temple, then God ſends them an <hi>Ezekil</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> even in Babylon, with viſions of God, to comfort them, and ſupport their ſpirits in all their afflictions; to preſerve them from Idolatry, amongſt Idolaters, and to diſcover all falſe Prophets that came with falſe hopes unto them, to deceive them. It is not baniſhment, nor fetters, nor priſons, can keep off the ſpecial preſence and diſcoveries of God from his afflicted ones, when they are loweſt, he is higheſt in grace and mercy towards them; when we are deepeſt in afflictions, God comes in with his greateſt conſolations: <hi>Thou remembredſt us in our low estate,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Let the godly comfort themſelves in this, that in their priſons, fetters, or Baniſhments, God will provide for them, his diſcoveries of mercy, grace, and conſolation, to bear up their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits under all extremities.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words, <hi>In the Kingdom and patience of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Here is ſome difficulty of interpretation. Indeed Kingdom in Scripture is of divers acceptation: ſomtimes it is taken for the coming of Chriſt in ſpirit, ſomtimes for the doctrine of the Goſpel, but chiefly for his tryumphant reigne at the day of his laſt appearance; and I conceive it is here to be taken in this latter ſenſe: for the ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and tribulation in the Scripture, is never called a Kingdom, and how unſutable it is unto it, all know; though they are ſaid to overcome, and to be more then conquerors herein: for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is beſtowed as a reward and crown to the faithful, holding out in this condition; conſult <hi>Reu.</hi> 2.7. and the tenth: and that which is beſtowed as the reſult and reward of their faithfulneſs under tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which is the kingdom; can in no good ſenſe be interpreted to be faithfulneſs under tribulation, the condition it ſelf; one thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the cauſe and the effect too: as a faithful holding out under perſecution is the cauſe <hi>(cauſa diſpoſitiva)</hi> the kingdom or reigning is as the fruits and effects, therefore not one and the ſame: ſo that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation or ſenſe of this verſe runs thus; I <hi>Iohn,</hi> your brother, and ſharer, or companion in tribulation with you, for the hopes in that kingdom which is to be revealed by Jeſus Chriſt at his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for which I, and you, and all Chriſt's faithful ones, wait for in patience, and longing deſirings, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.

by the coming of the Lord Jeſus, and his Kingdom. This is the Kingdom of patience and ſuffering, not of reigning and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing. Some of Chriſt's diſciples would needs have the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom preſently, in that their queſtion, <hi>Is this the time that thou wilt reſtore the Kingdom unto Iſrael?</hi> But Chriſt anſwered, It <hi>is not for you to know the time and ſeaſons;</hi> you are to occupy, employ your talents till I come. Of the ſouls beheaded for the teſtimony of Jeſus, <hi>How long Lord?</hi> is their continual cry: Their work is with prayers and tears to wait upon God for deliverance; they ſet not the world on fire by wars and bloodſhed, the proper works of Satan and his members; they are (to wit the Saints, or at leaſt ſhould be) of meek, placid and peaceable ſpirits, eaſily to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; when they are reviled, not to revile; when they are ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, not to ſtrike again; yea, to pray even for their very enemies: and to ſuch perſons, in God's appointed time, he will fulfil that promiſe, <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> This ſets a check upon the turbulent ones of this age, the ſoundneſs of whoſe ſpirit I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being oppoſite to the former characters of Chriſt's ſpirit; who conceive they go about to pull down Antichriſt, when they raiſe commotions, rebellions, and bloodſheds in ſtates and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and endeavour the ruine of the Soveraign Magiſtrates thereof; when as indeed, the proſecution of the work againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, is rather hindered then furthered hereby; for hereby they weaken and divert the hands of Soveraigns from that work, in as much as in them lieth: for antichriſt is to fall by the hands of thoſe Princes and Powers of the world from whom it had its firſt riſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.16. and therefore all ſhould rather add to their helping hands in aſſiſting thoſe Chriſtian Magiſtrates they live under, rather then diſturb or oppoſe them in this work: and for thoſe that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe minded, let them be here companions with <hi>John,</hi> Wait for his coming in faith and patience, and ſtand ſtill, and they ſhall ſee the ſalvation of our God.</p>

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> here comforts himſelf, and the Churches, with thoſe thoughts; in the next place he often inculcates this contemplation on them that ſhould be tryed, and come under tribulation; Chriſt would give them as the guerdon of all their ſufferings, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, deſcribed under ſeveral names, of the crown of life, <hi>v.</hi> 10.

This Iſland was one of the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, now called Archipelago, ſcituated between the leſſer Aſia and Greece, now under the command of the Grand Seignior, and in the way going up from the Mediterranean unto the Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont and Conſtantinople. This Iſland was famous for nothing ſo much as for this entertainment of our Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> in his exile, being one of thoſe barbarous Iſlands into which the Romans did uſe to ſend their malefactors and exiles: and here in this Iſland, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Barbarians, <hi>Iohn</hi> received theſe Viſions and Revelations, wherein obſerve.</p>

and this is no more then what Chriſt foretold of before his paſſion; that his Diſciples ſhould be offended becauſe of him, and that they ſhould be caſt out, impriſoned, reviled, and ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſecutions for his names ſake: And the ground or reaſon of all this, is, from that promiſe in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>That God would ſet enmity between the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the ſerpent;</hi> and this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity hath abided ever ſince, and will ever abide between thoſe two myſtical ſeeds, until the ſeed of the woman, Chriſt and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſhall become abſolute conquerors in the binding up the old ſerpent, who is the father of all enmities and miſchiefs. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth God's people, that it ſhould not ſeem ſtrange unto them, when the world and their enemies do rage againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Here a queſtion may come in, Whether chriſtians (when they are called unto it) are bound in duty to ſuffer for the profeſſion of all the Truths of God?</p>
                  <p>To clear this queſtion, I ſhall premiſe briefly, That Truths are either about fundamentals, or circumſtantials. Fundamentals are ſuch, as without the knowledge thereof, we cannot ordinarily be ſaved; and they are converſant either about the very being of a Saint and Chriſtian: or ſecondly, about the well-being, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and building up this Chriſtian in his holy faith; and theſe are called principles, or rudiments of Religion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. You know no one can proceed to be an Artiſt in any Art or Science, or come to any perfection therein, without ſome certain rules and principles to proceed by: ſo none can become a true Chriſtian or Artiſt in that heavenly Science of Chriſtianity, without ſome firſt laid principles: And amongſt thoſe Fundamentalls which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Being of a chriſtian, I believe, as ſome have been too large in the deſcription of their Fundamentals, ſo ſome have been too narrow; and therefore ſeeing they are not preciſely determined by any univerſal aſſembly of chriſtians, but are left to be gathered up here and there in the Word of God by parcels, I ſhall not be ſo preſumptuous, to define their certain number; only I ſay thus much, That that Creed which is called the Apoſtolical, ſetting a qualified ſenſe on that article of Chriſt's deſcent into hell, to be the exacteſt ſquare and rule of principles that relates unto the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Chriſtian, that is this day extant; and he that is not ready to ſuffer for the profeſſion thereof, is not worthy the name of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Now ſecondly, other Fundamentals are about the well-being of a chriſtian; and ſuch are all the Ordinances of the Goſpel: As, Baptiſm, Lord's Supper, Prayer, Thankſ-givings, all Church Orders and Fellowſhips, Preaching, Exhorting, Reproving, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeeing, and the like: And if it be in our power, we are rather to forbear the uſe of one of them, then to defile our ſouls or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences under corrupt adminiſtrations of them; but if at any time we were called to ſuffer for the eſſential truth of them, we are bound to ſuffer, and to bear them a teſtimony, as a part of the Truth and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53073:38"/>
Word of God. But for every opinion that ariſes about the right adminiſtrations of the latter, or manner of underſtanding of the former principles, which are but the circumſtantials of Religion, to ſet bonds upon the conſcience therein, it ſavours rather of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of contention, heat, and paſſion, then of found judgement, and chriſtian wiſdom. This is to make hard knots where there is none, and Chriſt calls his yoke eaſie, this were to make it burdenſom and intollerable: The ſubſtantial part of Chriſtian Religion is plain and eaſie, and the blinde may walk therein, and a lamb may wade tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: <hi>This is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> John 17.3. It is true, there are myſteries, high queſtions, and deep things of God in the word, theſe are for the exerciſe of our ſpirits and gifts, not of our faith, no further then as part of the revealed mind of God; and therefore we believe them to be truth, though we underſtand them not, which are reſerved until the day of the revelation of all things, when we ſhall know as we are known, and when all our ignorances and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections ſhall be done away. This ſets a check upon ſome hot ſpirits of theſe times, that rather then loſe or part with their wilde opinions, or let them lie unvented, would break all the bonds of peace, charity, and communion amongſt Chriſtians, and ſo utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprive the churches of Chriſt of all the benefit which otherwiſe their gifts and parts might ſtand in ſtead for. I doubt all ſorts of chriſtians of our times are too far baptized into this errour, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath too great a ſtroke in it to divide the hearts of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout circumſtantials, when as they hold one and the ſame funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals joyntly together: The Lord in mercy to his churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this great evil and ſin of our times.</p>

to receive thoſe divine Viſions, he is here ſaid to be rapt in Spirit: And the reaſons of this is, Firſt, That he might be the better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to take a clear and full view of thoſe divine diſcoveries which were about to be ſhown unto him: When we would ſhow one things diſtinctly, we uſe to place him up on high for the better ſight. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That he might have ſatisfaction in his own ſpirit that thoſe his viſions were from God, ſeeing he had ſo extraordinary taſte of the Spirit in the firſt place, he might well conclude he was now, as it were, to become the mouth of the Spirit unto the churches. Laſtly, That his thoughts and heart might have been ſequeſtred from things below, and his contemplation raiſed higher on things divine, as a true Prophet of God ought to have.</p>
                  <p>Another Note from hence is, as a corrollary to the former, That when Chriſt ſets up any eminent Officer, or Light in his church, for the ſervice thereof, God firſt fills them with his Spirit. When <hi>John</hi> was but upon entring upon his prophetical office, God raviſhes him with his Spirit, and fills him therewith, to fit him for this office: When men in the Apoſtles days were to be choſen but for the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervices in the Church, as for the over-ſight of the poor, and the like, yet they muſt be men full of the holy Ghoſt, and wiſdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3. Much more then for the higheſt places, as Prophets, Paſtors, Teachers, and Elders, &amp;c. It is ſaid, <hi>Paul and Barnabas were filled with the holy Ghoſt, and therefore to be ſeparated unto the work, Acts</hi> 11.24. and 13.2. The Offices of the churches of Chriſt, are for thoſe that have the Spirit of Chriſt in them, in ſome fulneſs of it: thoſe places are not for ſuch as are filled with the ſpirit of envie, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, pride, the world, contention, ignorance, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian lording; ſuch have not the ſpirit of Chriſt in them; it may be well ſaid of ſuch, that they run for profit here, and the like, but the Lord ſent them not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.14. and 23.21. They flatter themſelves, and think they are called and ſent of God, becauſe God hath given them ſome common acquired gifts and parts, yet want all the eſpecial graces of the Spirit as meekneſs, ſelf-denial, contempt of this world, humility, bowels of compaſſion, ready to forgive, ſound knowledge in the truth, and holineſs and righteouſneſs in their lives and converſations: they that want thoſe graces in the truth of them, are neither fit for thoſe high functions in the church, nor can ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyingly perſwade themſelves, or others, that they are called unto it: Let this be as a memento to all ſuch that climbe over the walls into thoſe holy Functions, and are well ſatisfied with a call from men, when they were never called of God; I ſay, let all ſuch fear and tremble, leſt God ſpew them all our, together with their flocks that would have it ſo, in his wrath, for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> was rapt in Spirit on the Lord's day: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, in the Greek: Whether this day be here called the Lord's day, for the great diſcoveries of thoſe viſions made unto <hi>John</hi> upon this day, or becauſe it was the Lord's day for the aſſembling of the Saints, to perform their ſervices unto God; it being the ſame day with that,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53073:39"/>
which the Apoſtles call the firſt day of the week, and our chriſtian Sabbath, I ſhall not much contend, but rather am enclined unto the latter, for theſe two reaſons. Firſt, Becauſe the great work of Chriſt's reſurrection, on that day wherein he was manifeſted Lord, and Conquerour over hell, and Satan, purchaſed it that Title of the Lords day. Secondly, Becauſe the obſervation of the Sabbath, with all chriſtian publique ſervices, were transferred to that day, and ſo is called the Lord's day, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or according to the Scottiſh dialect, the Kirks day, the Churches day, becauſe they held their aſſemblies, and performed their publique ſervices upon that day. Hence note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the Lord's day, or the day of the great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique aſſemblings of the Saints, is the fitteſt time for God's higheſt diſcoveries of Grace and Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> received here on this day, his high irradiations of ſpirit and Propheſies: This is God's great Market day, wherein there is a conſtant and mutual Exchange, or Bartering of heavenly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine commodities: the Saints come with the returns of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of mercies, in praiſes, prayers, and thankſgivings; God gives out in return, farther ſupplies of grace, and greater meaſure of knowledge in his ways and truths: Therefore ſure, moſt happy, moſt knowing, and moſt gracious are thoſe Saints that are moſt found in this way. O! this ſhould make all of us that are not in this way, to wail for it, as <hi>David</hi> in his abſence and exile from the church of God, that being the ſpecial habitation of God's glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.6. and to breath after it, even as the Hart brayeth after the fountain ſtreams: for this is the day of the Saints aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, wherein the Angel comes down, the Angel of the New Covenant, Chriſt in ſpirit, to ſtir upon the waters of Betheſda, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts and affections of all his people.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>John</hi> was in this rapture of ſpirit on the Lord's day, then he heard behind him a mighty voice, as it were of a Trumpet, loud and terrible: The Trumpet being a warlike Inſtrument, whoſe ſound is to prepare unto Battel, and to the terror of the adverſary. God's publique admonitions are ſo unto his church; it not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his own unto repentance, but is alſo of terrible ſignification unto all his impenitent enemies.</p>
                  <p>But here comes in a queſtion fit to be diſcuſſed; <hi>John</hi> had here his raptures of ſpirit, extaſies, and heard a great voice as of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet: The Quere will be, How ſhall we know Divine raptures, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, or viſions, from diabolical? For Satan is God's Ape, and hath his raptures, poſſeſſions, ſtrange apparitions, ſounds and voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer, firſt know, that God's viſions are given either in the ſleep, as unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he ſaw a ladder reaching from earth to heaven, and Angels aſcending and deſcending, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. but ſuch are more properly called Divine Dreams. Or ſecondly, When the perſon is awake, as here, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was at Patmos on the Lord's
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53073:39"/>
day, doubtleſs either in God's ſervices, or holy contemplations, he received thoſe viſions and raptures of ſpirit, and thoſe extaſies, or raptures of ſpirit, do cauſe a great alteration upon the perſon that receives them; he is as it were, taken out of himſelf that is in this poſture and frame; and therefore it is called a rapture or extaſie, <hi>quaſi extra ſe raptus,</hi> being in that poſture not maſter of the faculties of his own ſoul, which are wholly in the power and motions of the Spirit that acts them; and this is common to both ſorts of raptures, whether from the good or evil ſpirit: Now to diſcern what ſpirit moves in ſuch raptures or viſions, obſerve firſt, Whether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon paſſive, or that is under ſuch raptures of ſpirit, were always, or for the moſt part of their lives, faithful witneſſes unto the word of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt; ſuch have not only the promiſe of the holy Spirit to teach them all things, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.27. but to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved againſt the evil one, in their bodies, ſouls, and ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve the matter of their viſions in ſuch raptures, whether it be to denounce God's judgments againſt ſinful practiſes, or not; for ſurely Satan will never be divided againſt himſelf, if we will believe our Saviour, for ſo his kingdom could not ſtand; though I have read a ſtory in ſome old Popiſh Maſs-monger, that the divel once in the ſhape of a Prieſt, preached a very catholique ſermon, but being diſcovered by ſome Saint in preſence (it ſeems one of an excellent endowment in diſcerning ſpirits) asked him, how durſt Satan to appear in that preſence, with ſo ſound, holy, and catholique inſtructions in his mouth? The divel, or the diveliſh preacher anſwered him, that whilſt he preached good and ſound doctrine unto his auditors, and they were not followers of it, he had his end, even the aggravation of their condemnation for their neglect, inproficiency, and contempt of ſuch good doctrine: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how this odd deſigne ſhould come into the divel's head, I know not, being a liar from the beginning, and the truth abideth not in him, nor will confeſs it no further then he is compelled to do it by an over-maſtering divine power, this were indeed to deſtroy his own Kingdom: and God never ſends the evil ſpirits to be the meſſengers to provoke to break off from ſins, to live to God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and works of reformation, his very nature is contrary to ſuch works, and therefore is the great hinderer, not the promoter of them. This is another mark to diſcern of what ſpirits viſions are of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another diſtinguiſhing mark is, That in reſpect thoſe viſions and raptures of ſpirit carries with them a terribleneſs in the ſtrange apparitions therein, they leave a high and ſtrange impreſſion of ſpirit upon the parties under them; and thoſe that are from God, leaves always behind them, when they are paſſed away, a holy awe and reverence of the divine Majeſty and glory, and a contempt of themſelves and their own worthleſneſs. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet when he ſaw the Lord, and had diſcoveries of his glory, he could call out <hi>Wo is me! for I am undone, I am a man of unclean lips, for my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53073:40"/>
eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 6.5. <hi>Iob</hi> alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>cap.</hi> 42. 5, 6. <hi>Now mine eyes ſeeth thee, I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> The ſight of divine glory and majeſty doth always humble, in that it brings to ſight our own worthleſneſs, even in our beſt attainments in reſpect of it, which cauſeth a godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Now the contrary ſpirit brings contrary fruits and effects, as pride, vain-glory; &amp;c. and therefore not difficult to be differenced in their operations.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Viſions, extaſies, or raptures of the Divine Spirit, though often they may much grieve and trouble their ſpirits that are under them, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.15. and 8.27. and take away their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the preſent, and their ſtrength and comlineſs, and make them as it were, faint, dead, dumb, and breathleſs, as in <hi>Daniel, cap.</hi> 10. 8. 15. 17. verſes, and as <hi>Iohn</hi> in verſe 17. at the viſion of Chriſt, he fell at his feet as dead, and in the examples of <hi>Zachariah, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. yet after they are paſſed, they have no impairing in the parts either of their bodies or ſouls, but rather a greater glory put upon them, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe face did ſhine, coming from the preſence and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God. <hi>Paul</hi> grew a moſt eminent light, and the higheſt of all the Apoſtles, after he was ſtrucken as dead with his converting viſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>Iohn</hi> here receives great and high revelations from Chriſt, after he was ſtricken as dead at his feet, by the glory of the viſion. God is no hard maſter, none were ever loſers to be his inſtruments in this ſort; for unto ſuch he commonly adds greater additions of parts, grace, and glory.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, by the evil ſpirit's raptures or poſſeſſions, many have not only loſt the due temperature of their reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſo become altogether beſotted, and wittols, but have alſo their bodies impaired by the hard ſervice of their maſter. Hence it is, that as it is reported, and commonly by experience ſeen, of witches, and ſuch wretched creatures that are truly bewitched by the ſpirit of deluſion, and have given up themſelves as ſervants to his will, have the faculties of their ſouls ſo impaired and hurt by his poſſeſſions, and daylie diſturbing of them, he being an Apolly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or deſtroyer from the beginning, that being broken in their reaſons, they conceive in their raptures, that they are transformed into ſtrange ſhapes, of cats, dogs, hares, &amp;c. and in an inſtant to be tranſported and carried into far places diſtant, and in and out to houſes, though the doors were ſhut; things in themſelves above the efficiency of any creature, and contradictory to nature, and all its works: and unleſs perſons of ſuch belief makes two Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, it can never ſtand. Indeed the true ground hereof, and of all their confeſſions in this kind, proceeds from hence, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel from whom they have their frequent extaſies and raptures, hath ſo befooled them in their underſtandings, that they do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe things to be really done and acted, which the divel does repreſent unto them in their extaſies and trances, and ſo when they are out of them, having loſt their reaſons, believes, and often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53073:40"/>
them to be of truth, though many of them be impoſſibilities in nature, without a miracle, and had never a being, further then in the fancies of their confuſed and diſturbed brains: This is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the divel's inſtruments in this kind.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, If all theſe former diſtinguiſhing marks fail, for a hypocrite may go very far in complying with the ſigns of God's word, yet herein he cannot deceive; to wit, in the truth of his viſion or revelation, in the event thereof; this will be ſure to try him, whether his viſion be from God or not. Events diſcovers viſions, and diſtinguiſhes prophets, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.9. <hi>The prophet which propheſieth of peace, when the word of the prophet ſhall come to paſs, then ſhall the prophet be known that the Lord hath truly ſent him;</hi> and this is according to that of <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.21, 22. The queſtion is, How we ſhall know whether a viſion be from God or not? Look to the event, if it comes to paſs, it is of God; if not, it is a lie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſied againſt Jeruſalem, <hi>Hananiah,</hi> and other falſe prophets, the contrary; <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.2, 3, 4. <hi>Ahab</hi> feared not to go againſt <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> whiles <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the falſe prophet told him, <hi>Go and proſper,</hi> 1 Kings 22. but when the words of <hi>Micaiah</hi> proved true to <hi>Ahab</hi> in his deſtruction, then the falſe prophets were confounded, and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> ran into an inner chamber to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But hath not the divel often foretold the truth of events? Yes, but not with that clearneſs, as the divine Spirit does; he leaves no heſitation or doubting on which ſide the overthrow will be: The Beaſt, together with the falſe Prophet, and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, muſt be taken and deſtroyed; the Saints muſt remain the conquerors: Satan in his predictions, is but as a good gueſſer, or conjecturer at beſt, to keep his credit good with his complices; he gives out his predictions in riddles, or aenigma's, as of old, in the Oracles at Delphos.</p>
                  <q>Aio te Aeacides Romanos vincere poſſe.</q>
                  <p>Or that of <hi>Croeſus:</hi>
                     <q>Croeſus Halyn penetrans magnam pervertet opum vim.</q>
Both which may be taken in a diverſe ſenſe, which the conſtructors took in advantage, as to themſelves, and ſo proved to both fatal, in not applying them the right way. Again, if Satan foretells any thing, it is only gathered from the obſervation of the affairs of the world, and his long experienced converſing in them, and this at beſt can be but conjectural, and therefore keeps himſelf to thoſe dark ways of delivery. Laſtly, To aſcribe to Satan truth in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of events, it would rob God of his glory, and one of his great prerogatives, which he alone by his Spirit hath often mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to his ſervants the Prophets, for the good and comfort of his church and people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53073:41"/>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But did not Satan tell <hi>Saul,</hi> in that apparition of <hi>Samuel,</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.19. That he ſhould be delivered, with all his hoſt, into the hands of the Philiſtines, and that he and his ſons on the morrow ſhould be all with <hi>Samuel,</hi> that is dead? And was not that prediction truly fulfilled?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, Amongſt Expoſitors there is a great difference of opinions about the meaning of this place: They that hold it was <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf, who was at reſt, have but ſmall ſtore of reaſon for it, for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe God will not ſend one from the dead to exhort the living: <hi>They have Moſes, and the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is improbable that God would ſend <hi>Samuel,</hi> who would not let him to anſwer <hi>Saul</hi> in his life time, becauſe God had forſaken him, would now ſend him from the dead to adviſe him, and then too, when he was adviſing with Wizards and Witches, which was utterly forbidden by God in his Law. But the current of moſt Expoſitors hold, That it was the divel in the appearance or likeneſs of <hi>Samuel.</hi> But herein ſubmitting to the judicious and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning judgements, I here lay down ſome conſiderations to the contrary: If this were Satan in the ſhape of <hi>Samuel,</hi> it is ſtrange he would leave ſuch an excellent leſſon to all poſterity, to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and prejudice of his own kingdom, as this is: <hi>Saul</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from God, and diſobeyed his voice, therefore God was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him, and given his kingdom unto another, even unto <hi>David, ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. and at laſt, for this his diſobedience, would deſtroy him and his family by the hands of their enemies: Now this is againſt that former ſaying of our Saviour's, <hi>A King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom divided, cannot ſtand;</hi> is Satan divided againſt himſelf: Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto this the reaſons a little before mentioned, and judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever that ſpirit of lies, and enmity to mankind, would leave ſuch a good and fruitful leſſon for the children of men upon record, to his prejudice for ever. For this reaſon I am hardly induced to believe, that this was Satan in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s apparition, but rather a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening confederate of the Pythoniſt of Endor, ſet up by her in a ſecret corner, deſcribed by her, or ſet up in the ſhape and garments of the old and famous Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> who was but lately dead, and therefore his poſtures, garments, and alſo his propheſies of rending the Kingdom from <hi>Saul,</hi> and giving it unto <hi>David,</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well known unto all Iſrael; and therefore this witch of Endor could not be ignorant of it, being but a little way diſtant from the Court of <hi>Saul,</hi> where <hi>Samuel</hi> was often converſant in his life time, as appears from verſ. 7, and 8. campared with 25: And alſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unto me, that <hi>Saul</hi> here in the whole tranſaction, did not ſee the counterfeit <hi>Samuel,</hi> by that his queſtion in verſ. 14. <hi>What form is he of And ſhe ſaid, an old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle:</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> perceiving by this deſcription of hers that it was <hi>Samuel,</hi> he bows himſelf, and ſo proceeds to his buſineſs with this <hi>Samuel</hi> or counterfeit, which might lie hid behind ſome ſhrine, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53073:41"/>
or grate, where the whole cozenage is tranſacted; and how eaſily <hi>Saul</hi> was to be caught and deceived in this kind, appears from his diſtraction, conſternation, and fear he was in, being ſerround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his enemies, forſaken of God, and ſeeking unto witches in this time of trouble: This wiſe woman, or witch of Endor, with her confederate, knew well enough that this was <hi>Saul,</hi> being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the head then all Iſrael, though diſguiſed, and by his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and ſervants with him, from the beginning of this whole art of cozenage, though ſhe counterfeited the contrary, verſe 12. This appears from her neighbourhood with the Court, he coming to her, and after all theſe cozening tranſactions, returning the ſame night again, verſe 25. whereas this counterfeit is here often called <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> took him indeed to be <hi>Samuel;</hi> yet this makes it no more to be true and real <hi>Samuel,</hi> then if it had been granted that it was the divel in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s ſhape: ſo that under correction of better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I am of opinion, this was not Satan in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s likeneſs, that left this uſeful leſſon and prediction, for the reaſons aboveſaid, but rather proceeded from the cozening Pythoniſt of Endor, and her well-informed confederate, who well knew of the prediction of the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> that God would take off the kingdom from <hi>Saul,</hi> and give it unto his ſervant <hi>David,</hi> becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> had diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God's voice in the buſineſs of <hi>Agag;</hi> and this ſhe could foreſee was the time, in that the Philiſtines, the enemies of Iſrael, were come up againſt him, and he knew not which way to turn, for God had forſaken him, and had denied to anſwer him either by Prophet, Urim, or Thummim. I have been ſomwhat the longer herein, to ſtave the divel off, that he may not have any hand in God's prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative in foretelling the truth of events. If it were granted that this were the Divel in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s likeneſs, yet I anſwer, the Divel might well gather the truth of this prediction concerning the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his ſons, from that of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s propheſie againſt him, when in his life time at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> he came and told him, that God would rend his kingdom from him, for not obeying his word, and give it unto his ſervant <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.14. And therefore the Divel here might well predict the ſame unto <hi>Saul,</hi> coming to him to know the event and ſucceſs of his undertaking againſt the Philiſtines: But in the time, and ſome other circumſtances of this prediction, whether it proceeded from Satan, or the cozening Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoniſt, yet there is a palpable failure therein; to ſhow, that God's Spirit alone is the ſpirit of propheſie, and the ſure foretelling of all events in the full truths thereof: for this pretended <hi>Samuel,</hi> tells <hi>Saul,</hi> that to morrow he and his ſons ſhould be with him, that is, in the ſtate of death. But obſerve, if this were the Divel, how this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies keeps on his old trade of lying; for indeed, <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſons were not overthrown nor ſlain by the Philiſtines on the morrow, but ſome days after; as appeareth by conſidering the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral tranſactions done by <hi>David,</hi> in the 29, and 30 chapters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Amalekites, after he was diſmiſſed from the Army of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53073:42"/>
Philiſtines, before they fell upon <hi>Saul</hi> and his Army to their utter overthrow, <hi>chap.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 3. &amp;c. It is alſo ſomwhat againſt reaſon that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be all the precedent night at <hi>Endor,</hi> and on his way coming and going, and that under great dejection, trouble, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, by reaſon of his hard fate foretold him; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, he ſhould the immediate morrow joyn Battel with the Philiſtines, is in my apprehenſion a very unlikely conceit. I ſhall only add, and conclude with that of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>O teach us O Lord, to number our days, that we may apply, our hearts unto wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> that both God and the creature may have their dues.</p>

                  <p>After <hi>John</hi> was ſet by a ſpiritual rapture in a fit frame and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to receive thoſe divine and excellent Revelations, he in this verſe makes an entrance into his firſt viſion, which was the effect of that great and mighty voice that he heard, as of a Trumpet, ſaying, <hi>I am Alpha, and Omega,</hi> &amp;c. This was Chriſt, as is manifeſted in verſe 8. compared to the 9. who is the beginning and laſt of all things, and who is the giver out, and author of this Revelation unto <hi>John,</hi> and gives him this viſion concerning the ſeven Churches, by way of an admonitory Epiſtle unto them; and what he ſees, and ſhall be repreſented unto him in thoſe viſions: he is commanded to write them down, and ſend them to the ſeven famous Churches, which then were in Aſia minor, at Epheſus, Smyrna, &amp;e.

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the true Miniſters of the Goſpel muſt deal very faithfully with their churches in their doctrines and propheſies; they muſt come with real viſions of God, not feigned ones. <hi>Paul</hi> did profeſs unto thoſe he wrote, that he kept nothing back for their good, but diſcovered the whole mind of God unto them: They are to obſerve God's motions and directions; when he moves, they muſt move; when he ſtands ſtill, ſo muſt they. If God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them to come with the doctrines of peace and conſolation, they are not to come with the doctrines of judgements, and if God proceeds in anger, wrath, and judgments againſt a people for their ſins; the Miniſters ought not, like the falſe Prophets in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> preach peace, peace, and ſew pillows under their elbows, to build them up in ſecurity, and ſo make them ripe for deſtruction; neither are they only in a perfunctory way to preach the mind of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their churches, but they muſt follow <hi>John</hi>'s example here, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever viſion or burden is made known unto them from the Lord, they muſt for the more certainty, and better obſervation thereof, write it down, and ſend it, and commit it to their churches keeping:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53073:42"/>
this rule the Apoſtles kept, in committing their doctrines unto wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, a ſure way of preſerving it for the churches of Chriſt, to the end of all.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> having heard this great and terrible voice, he turned to ſee the voice that ſpake unto him: Either this is to be taken metonimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, where ſeeing is put for underſtanding; that is, he turned rightly and diſtinctly to underſtand the voice he heard: or elſe to be taken per Synecdochen, part for the whole; that is, he turned to ſee the voice, that is, the perſon that uttered the voice. From hence note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That God's faithful ones are very intent to know the mind of God in all the diſcoveries of his Will. They are not thoſe that deſire to know their maſter's will darkly, and in part, they are willing to know it fully, that they may fully obey it: It is but a fruitleſs hearing, to hear the voice only in the miniſtery of the Word of God, and not be intent upon the intendment and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. The word of God (though it be the power of life unto all that believe) yet without this, is but as a meer voice, and a dead letter. Thoſe with <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 9. when he was ſtrucken down when he was going to Damaſco, heard the voice, but ſaw not him that ſpake unto him; ſo many in our days, do hear the ſame voice of God, that ſtrikes thorow other ſouls unto converſion, whiles they neither ſee nor underſtand the meaning of God in the voice, either to their comfort or converſion.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was <hi>John</hi> turned, to comprehend more diſtinctly this voice that ſpoke unto him, but preſently he had a viſion preſented him, of the ſeven golden Candleſticks, and one like unto the Son of man in the mids of them; what is meant by the ſeven golden Candleſticks, I refer to the laſt verſe of this chapter, where the Spirit it ſelf is Interpreter: But by the way this Note ariſeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That God reſerveth his choiſeſt diſcoveries for the moſt diligent and enquiring ſouls. <hi>John</hi> when he turned to ſee the voice, and being turned, he ſaw ſeven golden Candleſticks, &amp;c. When ſouls turn to God, and enquire carefully after his will, God will be found of them, they are the Treaſurers of his mind; <hi>The ſecrets of the Lord are with thoſe that fear him:</hi> They ſhall know the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in all the revolutions and providential percuſſions of the Nations of the world. If the Statiſts of the world would know what would be the event of things, their beſt counſellors would be ſuch as are the wiſe and diligent obſervers (not of Stars, flying of Birds, the bowels of Beaſts, and ſuch Ethnick fopperies) but of the voice of God in his holy Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53073:43"/>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. The things contained in this book of Propheſies are moſt certain. <hi>John</hi> ſaith not he heard only a voice, but he ſaw ſeven golden Candleſticks, &amp;c. The ſenſe of ſight is the moſt certain, moſt evidential of all the ſenſes, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.3. And indeed this whole book is a book of viſions, preſented unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> and which he ſaw in Patmos: Now in all viſions there are ſome repreſentations made either to the eye of the body externally, or to the eye of the minde internally.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In every viſion there is ſomthing that is Future, and therefore it is ſomtimes called propheſie, or prediction, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The party to whom it is made, hath a ſtrong irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, and mighty light over-powering him, to make him obedient unto that heavenly viſion, and ſo is put out of all doubt of the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is in great evidence when the party is awake. Dreams are but obſcurer viſions when men are aſleep; and therefore viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the more evident and excellent diſcoveries of the truth.</p>
                  <p>In this firſt viſion, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw ſeven golden Candleſticks, and in the mids of them, one like the Son of man, &amp;c. Some may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this perſon here repreſented in the likeneſs of the Son of man, to be ſome Angel, and not Chriſt; becauſe he is ſaid to be like the Son of man, and not the Son of man, but an Angel which Chriſt deputized, as <hi>v.</hi> 1. to give theſe viſions unto <hi>Iohn.</hi> But to refel this opinion, I offer theſe reaſons. Firſt, He is called the Α and Ω in verſe 8. and in chap. 2. verſ. 18. where the ſame perſon is deſcribed, he is called the Son of God; Now ſure God would never give theſe Titles, and his peculiar Attributes, unto creature-Angels, but unto his Son, who is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not only conſimiliar, but conſubſtantial with the Father; and <hi>who counts it no robbery to be equal with God:</hi> For, unto which of the Angels hath he ſaid, ye are the Α and Ω, the firſt, and the laſt? Or, ye are the Sons of God? Or, unto which of the Angels hath he ſaid, as in verſe 18. <hi>ye are alive, but ye were dead;</hi> or, <hi>ye have the keys of hell, and of death?</hi> Surely no creature in heaven or in earth will take theſe high Titles and Prerogatives unto themſelves, but Chriſt himſelf; and therefore this likeneſs of the Son of man in this viſion, muſt needs be Chriſt: And by the way, I would have the obſervant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon take notice, that it is not very difficult to diſcern what viſions in this book are given forth by Chriſt, and what by Angels, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the deſcriptions of the parties that gives them; for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and moſt remarkable viſions, Chriſt gives out himſelf, but the leſs principal, he diſcovers by his miniſters, the Angels. But to leave nothing in the dark: Some may ſay, Why may not this be the Father who appeared unto <hi>Daniel?</hi> chap. 7. 9. who is there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Ancient of days, whoſe garment was white as ſnow, and the hair of his head as pure wool, his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels were as burning fire? The deſcription of this perſon here in <hi>Daniel,</hi> is almoſt the ſame with this in the Revelation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53073:43"/>
the 11. 14, and 15 verſes together. I anſwer, firſt, The Learned do obſerve, That neither the Father, nor the holy Spirit, have ever appeared in the likeneſs or the ſhape of man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Anthropomorphites have abuſed this place, to maintain their groſs opinion, of the corporiety and circumſcription of the infinite Deity; and therefore the all-wiſe Spirit of God, to prevent the miſtakes of man about the inviſible and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature of God, deſcribes this viſion of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the likeneſs and appearance of things; not that they were materially ſo: It is the likeneſs of a Throne, and like a fiery flame, &amp;c. And in the 13 verſe, like the Son of man; no true ſubſtantial body, nor material viſions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, This muſt be the perſon of the Son in the likeneſs of man, for the reaſons immediately foregoing, who was dead, but is alive; and he that ſhould attribute this to the Father, or the Spirit, ſhould want ſome Hellebore.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This muſt be Chriſt, becauſe we find in Scripture, that Chriſt hath often appeared in viſions like unto man, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. <hi>I ſaw in the night Viſions, and behold one like the Son of man;</hi> Ezek. 1.26. and Rev. 14.14. <hi>I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud, one ſate like unto the Son of man:</hi> and that this was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son, and not the Father, or the holy Spirit, is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from verſe 18. of chap. 2. where one and the ſame perſon that is in the 13, 14, and 15, verſes, here deſcribed in the mids of the ſeven Churches, or the ſeven golden Candleſticks, who had his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine braſs; in the 18. verſe of chap. 2. he commands <hi>John</hi> to write to Thyatira, one of the ſeven Churches. <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Son of God, which hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like unto fine braſs.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be brief, that perſon that is here called the Son of God, is neither the Father, nor the Spirit, but Chriſt, the eternal Son of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quere.</hi> But was not this appearance then in the likeneſs of the Son of man, truly man, or Chriſt the Son of man? Seeing you hold it was the perſon of Chriſt, was it Chriſt according to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It was Chriſt, but not Chriſt as the Son of man; for it is a maxime, that <hi>nullum ſimile eſt idem;</hi> and here he is called, like the Son of man, therefore not the true and proper Son of man. The heavens was to contain his manhood until the reſtauration of all things; though his Divinity is ubiquitary, omnipreſent, and omnipotent, yet his manhood is circumſcribed, and terminated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one place at once; if it be in heaven, it cannot be on earth; it aſcended there, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10, 11. and <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw him there, even the Son of man, at the right hand of his Father, in glory, <hi>Act</hi> 7.56. not by a viſional repreſentation, but truly and really: As God gave <hi>Stephen</hi> this glorified ſight of the Son of man in heaven, ſo God doubtleſs fitted and qualified his organical inſtruments of ſight
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53073:44"/>
above their common pitch, to reach an object at ſo high a diſtance; when God will work wonderfully, he can turn Nature out of its proper frame, either in elevating it beyond its own power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, or to hinder it in its own peculiar operations: He can make the Sun to ſtand ſtill, as in the days of <hi>Joſhua:</hi> He can make the eye to ſee a thouſand miles diſtance, as unto <hi>Stephen;</hi> he can bind up the fiery flames, that they ſhall not hurt or burn, as unto the three children in the fiery Furnace, walking therein without ſcortch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hair. But to return, If Chriſt, as the Son of man, be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then he is not on the earth; he is not tranſubſtantiated, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into, or with the Bread in the Sacrament, as the Papiſts and ſome Lutherans dream of.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly I anſwer, Chriſt here appears to <hi>John,</hi> as he did to the Prophets of old before his Incarnation; that is to ſay, by his Deity and Godhead, being transfigured into the likeneſs of man, and taking up the form of man, as being moſt ſutable to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and nature of man, and ſo manifeſts himſelf in the ſhape or form of man, otherwiſe the Divine Nature in it ſelf is inviſible, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. and 10.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14. Before Chriſt's Incarnation, he appears in the likeneſs of man; to ſhow, that in time he would become the true and real Son of man, by aſſuming fleſh into union with his Godhead: and ſince his Aſcenſion, he appears in the likeneſs of man; to teach us, that one day he will in the true humane nature, come again to judge the ſons of men: He was from his firſt undertaking for fallen man, even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the great Adminiſtrator and Agent for his Father, and ſo will be, until the end of all, under ſeveral appearances, to wit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Spirit and Power, as now in the days of the Goſpel; or ſecondly, in viſional repreſentations, as here in the likeneſs of man, and to the Prophets of old: Or thirdly and laſtly, in his real humane nature, as the Son of man, as in his firſt and ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may here unadviſedly ſay, If this be the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt that appeared here to <hi>Iohn</hi> in the likeneſs of man, and his manhood in heaven, why then there may be a ſeparation between the Deity and the Manhood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But this objection ſavours of much ignorance of the nature of the Deity: Though the Deity, I grant, is moſt eminently conjunct with the manhood in heaven, for that is the moſt ſpecial and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent habitation of his glory, yet this doth not at all hinder, but that that infinite Deity, which is one with the humanity in heaven, doth from thence flow, and extend it ſelf moſt infinitely over the whole Univerſe; and therefore is not only moſt glorious in heaven, but all other ſublunary places alſo are filled with his glorious preſence, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, 119.8. <hi>If I aſcend up unto heaven, why, thou art there, that is the habitation of thy glory: If I go down unto the deeps, thou art there alſo,</hi> thy power, and wonderful providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al workings, are ſeen there alſo. This is made good by that old verſe,

Therefore it is not ſtrange that Chriſt ſhould here appear unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Deity, as the Son of God, and not as the Son of man, but in the form or likeneſs of the Son of man: For if Chriſt had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to <hi>Iohn</hi> in his humanity, as he did unto <hi>Stephen,</hi> he had then called him the Son of man; but taking only the likeneſs of the Son of man, he is called cap. 2. 18. the Son of God, and not the Son of man, being under a figure like to his humanity: his humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being in heaven ſince his Aſcenſion, and is there to abide, until the latter day. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.34, 35.</p>
                  <p>From this figure of Chriſt's appearance in the likeneſs of man, obſerve: That the Divine nature of Chriſt, is too glorious for the eyes of man to behold; therefore is here repreſented to <hi>Iohn</hi> under the form of man: the more excellent glory is here ſhaddowed under that is leſs glorious. If Chriſt had opened his divine nature and glory unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the fulneſs of it, as it is in it ſelf, other then in ſome darker repreſentations of it, it would have overwhelmed <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſlain him: <hi>No man can ſee me, and live,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33.18. when he deſired God to ſhew him his glory: This repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation unto <hi>Iohn</hi> was ſo glorious, though in the likeneſs of man, that <hi>Iohn</hi> profeſſeth in verſe 17. when he <hi>ſaw it,</hi> he <hi>fell at his feet as dead.</hi> If we cannot behold (without prejudice) the Sun in its glory, how can we behold the exceeding glory of the Creator, whoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exceeds infinitely the glory of all the creatures, as far as infinity exceeds all finite Beings: the ſight of the glory of that Majeſty, would turn us into nothing: If the Lord ſhould not condeſcend to our weakneſs, and ſhrine up his Majeſty under the form of man, there could be no communion between him and us: Oh the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, that condeſcends to our capacities!</p>
                  <p>From Chriſt's appearing in the mids of the ſeven golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks; Note, That Chriſt ſits as King and ſupream Moderator and Governour in his Churches. And this is couched in theſe words, <hi>In the mids of them:</hi> for a King, ſupream Captain, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, ſits in his throne, in the mids of his Nobles and ſervants, being environed about with attendants, for his greater Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>This perſon here in the likeneſs of the Son of man, in the mids of the ſeven Candleſticks, which denotes Chriſt's Kingly Office, being farther deſcribed by his garments, being clothed with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment down to the feet, betokening gravity and wiſdom; this ſort of garment was worn of the Prieſts of old, and alſo of the Roman Senators, the Scribes and Phariſees, and Doctors of the Law, in Chriſt's time, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.38. uſed alſo this kind of garment, and Chriſt here appears in this garb, which doth typically repreſent

both his Prieſtly office, and his Prophetical office alſo; for the Prieſts and Prophets under the Law, were to be arrayed in ſuch long garments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.42, 43. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.10. and <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet miniſtred in ſuch a garment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.18. Hence obſerve.</p>
                  <p>That when Chriſt makes diſcovery of himſelf to his Churches, he deſires to manifeſt himſelf in all his Offices. When he appears here among theſe Aſian Churches in a Kingly way and Power, to chaſtiſe them for their backſlidings, yet he appears too in a Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal garment, under his Prieſtly office, interceding for his poor backſliding people; and withal, exerciſes his Prophetical Office, in admoniſhing them to return to their firſt love, whom they had forſaken. Chriſt will not be wanting in any of his offices, for the good and benefit of his Churches; and therefore he is ſaid here, <hi>to be girt about the Paps with a golden Girdle,</hi> which denotes Chriſt's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs in all his offices for their good: conſult <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. and 17.8. When the Romans of old did undertake any matter of action, they did uſe to truſs up their long garments, for the better expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their actions; ſo Chriſt here is ſaid to be girt with a precious and golden girdle, to manifeſt his readineſs for his Churches ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, either as King, to rule and chaſtiſe them, as a Prieſt, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for them, and as a Prophet, to inform them.</p>

                  <p>This appearance, or likeneſs of the Son of man, is farther deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to have his head and hairs white as wool, and as ſnow; and the Ancient of days in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9. is ever under the ſame figures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; white hairs, and white head, ſhows gravity, age, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, worthy of all due reverence: according to that of the Poet,

                  <p>From this deſcription, Note, That Chriſt as the Son of God, is of the ſame antiquity with the Father, even one and the ſame co-eternal God, bleſſed for ever: For God who is called the Ancient of days in that viſion of <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.9. manifeſted himſelf in the like appearance, as he doth here unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the likeneſs of the Son of man; therefore is one and the ſame God, having the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable properties with the Ancient of days.</p>
                  <p>He is here farther deſcribed to have eyes as a flame of fire, and feet like unto fine braſs, burning as in a furnace. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. That when Chriſt is about executing acts of power and judgement againſt Kingdoms or Churches, he is moſt terrible in his appearance.</p>
                  <p>When he goes about to call to an account the ſeven Aſian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he is very intenſe about it, and all of a fiery colour: ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the eyes like fire, does ſignifie much anger and indignation; feet of burning braſs, ſpeed and execution: Chriſt is here preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that fine poſture; he is brought in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.1. with his face ſhining as the Sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, whereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently followed terrible thunders, and dreadful judgements. So in chap. 2. v. 18. he is preſented with eyes like fire, and feet like braſs, and forthwith goes on with a charge againſt the Church of Thyatira. So in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10, 11, 12. he is ſaid to have his eyes like a flame of fire, and his veſture dipt in blood, and preſently goes on in executing great wrath againſt his adverſaries. The dreadfulneſs of this fiery Judge, when he comes in wrath, will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear, if we conſider that of the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>Who ſhall abide the day of his coming? and who ſhall ſtand when he appears? for he is like a Refiners fire.</hi> A Refiners fire is the hotteſt, moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and moſt conſuming. How terrible he is towards Babylon, both literal and myſtical, conſider <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.25. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8, 9, &amp;c. <hi>I am againſt thee, oh deſtroying mountain</hi> (ſpeaking of Babylon) <hi>which deſtroyeſt all the earth; I will ſtretch out my hand upon thee, and rowl thee down from the Rock, and will make thee a burnt mountain.</hi> This was fully executed on old Babylon in the letter. And how ſevere is Chriſt againſt Babylon in the myſterie! in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Her plagues ſhall come at one day, death, and ſorrow, and famine, and ſhe ſhall be burnt with fire; for ſtrong is the Lord God which will condemn her.</hi> Peruſe the chapter throughout. When Chriſt goes forth on his red horſe, to execute judgement, and to take peace from the earth, neither Kings, nor Captains, nor the mighty ones of the earth, ſhall be able to ſtand againſt this mighty one: <hi>They ſhall call for the mountains to fall upon them, to hide them from the face of him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. of the dreadfulneſs of this Judge, who ſhould come in flames of fire; to what end, to deſtroy Antichriſt, the ſon of perdition, with the brightneſs of his coming: only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider once more <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.12, 13, &amp;c. When Chriſt goeth forth to make war in righteouſneſs, his eyes were like a flame of fire, and was clothed in a garment dipt in blood, and out of his mouth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a ſharp ſword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the heathen; for he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron, for he it is that treadeth the wine-preſs of the fierceneſs and wrath of almighty God. All this doth clearly inform, that Chriſt hath another name, a ſtrange name, that none knoweth but himſelf, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.12. that is, another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſpoſition to appear in, then of a Lamb: No man ever
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53073:46"/>
thought, that have only conſidered Chriſt in the ſtate of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, that he had that Lion-like diſpoſition in him: All Chriſt's adverſaries ſhall one day know, that he is as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, whoſe voice ſhall be terrible unto them, as well as a Rock of defence and ſafeguard to all his choſen ones; and as ſure as he hath already acted the Lamb-like part in his ſufferings here on earth, and now doth the ſame in his Mediators office in heaven, ſo he ſhall one day come with power and glory, to rule the Nations of the earth, that would not have him for their Lord and King, even with a Scepter of power and judgement, and with a rod of iron. And to ſet forth the dreadfulneſs of this Judge the more, he comes with a Lion-like voice, roaring, as the ſound of many waters. Hence Note,</p>

That when Chriſt comes to judge his enemies, he is not only dreadful in his looks, and outward appearance, but he is dreadful all over, even in his words alſo. In verſe 10. his voice was as of a Trumpet, loud, and terrible; here, like the ſound of many waters, very terrible to his enemies, but rouzing, converting, and ſaving to his faithful ones.</p>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding Chriſt's dreadful appearance, and his intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto judgement, yet he had in his right hand ſeven ſtars. In the right hand is ſeated the chiefeſt ſtrength and power of man, and ſo it connotes to us ſafety and protection; and he takes the ſeven ſtars into his right hand, to preſerve and keep them ſafe under his protection, whilſt he is executing his judgements upon his impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent backſliding churches, or obſtinate enemies.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven ſtars the Spirit interprets to be the Angels of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven churches, verſe 20. of this chapter; only what is meant by Angels in that place, being myſtically repreſented by the ſtars in Chriſt's right hand, I think fit to make enquiry here: Surely it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant Angels in a proper ſenſe, ſuch as are miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Angels in heaven; for <hi>John</hi> is commanded in the next chapter to write unto thoſe Angels of the church of Epheſus, Smyrna, &amp;c. to write unto the Spirits Angelical; all know ſuch a command would not proceed from him that is the wiſdom of the Father; therefore this muſt needs be interpreted to be the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or Paſtors of thoſe Aſian churches, who ſhould rather be called here the Meſſengers, then the Angels of the churches; for the word in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is Meſſenger, which we tranſlate Angel, when attributed to God's miniſtring Spirits; but when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto man, more properly it ſhould be rendered Meſſenger, and not Angel; as that of <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 12. When he came and knocked at the door where the Diſciples were, they thought it was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53073:46"/>
his Angel, and not himſelf; that is his Meſſenger, one coming from him to acquaint them of his deliverance; for they could not be ſo ignorant to conceive that it was an Angel that knocked, which could enter without opening the doors; wherefore under correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of better Iudgements, I ſhall account this amongſt ſome of the miſtakes of our Tranſlators. Conſult to this purpoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.24. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. and therefore it ſhould be better rendered here, Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, write unto the Meſſengers of the ſeven churches: And the Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſo termed, becauſe they are perſons ſent and commiſſionated by Chriſt, to preach, and teach his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel amongſt his churches, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. Having cleared what is meant by the Angels, or ſeven Stars of the Aſian churches, I ſhall draw theſe notes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Chriſt hath an eſpecial eye of providence, and hand of protection over all his faithful Miniſters of his Word, in the moſt terrible times of wrath and judgement. He takes them in his right hand, claps them under his wings for ſafety. <hi>Noah</hi> who was a preacher of righteouſneſs, was preſerved in the Ark, when all the world was drowned: Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was preſerved, when So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom flamed in fire: <hi>Ezekiel, Daniel, Mordecai,</hi> &amp;c. were preſerved in Babylon, when the Inhabitants of Judah ſuffered all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that an inſolent Conquerour could lay upon them. How <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was preſerved when all the antichriſtian world ſought his ruine, is moſt admirable to conſider: I have heard it related, that that moſt famous Miniſter of Chriſt, <hi>Peter du Molyne,</hi> was preſerved in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, being a ſucking childe, by his Nurſe under a tub, when the bloody maſſacers did not ſpare man, woman, or childe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Faith; that he might afterward become a ſtar in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's church. And the reaſon of all this is, they that are moſt engaged for Chriſt in his work and miniſtery, he does moſt engage for their ſafety and protection; Satan is their greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, therefore Chriſt is their greateſt friend and bulwark. Oh that all the Miniſters of our churches were ſhining ſtars, faithful Angels, or rather, faithful Meſſengers of God's word and truth! Then Chriſt would carry them in his right hand of protection, and they ſhould be as the apple of his eye unto him. The Angels, Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or chief Miniſters of theſe ſeven Aſian churches are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by ſtars: Stars always in prophetical Scriptures, ſignifie eminency, ſplendour, light, and excellency. <hi>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, thou ſon of the morning!</hi> meaning <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> Iſa. 14.12. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.10. <hi>I ſaw a ſtar fall from heaven;</hi> which connotes the fall of a moſt eminent, high, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon. From hence note.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe that are the diſpenſers of Chriſts myſteries, ought to be more eminent and excellent in knowledge and holineſs, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour chriſtians. They are figured by ſtars, by the ſhining heavenly lamps, they are the ſalt of the earth, their lips ſhould eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially preſerve wiſdom, they ſhould be as ſtars of the greater magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53073:47"/>
ſhining in the firmament of their churches; they are the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers of the flock, to go in and out before them in ſoundneſs of life and doctrine: yet too, though their light be great, ſhining, and eminent, yet let them conſider they are but ſtars, their light is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Sun, they ſhould not advance it to that pitch, as to make it an infallible light, but they ſhould eye the Son, as the fountain of all true light, to keep them in their proper Sphere, and not to lord it over the Lord's inheritage: Let them remember too, that they are ſtars, whereof ſome may be erratique, as well as fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones; Chriſt alone is the true light, the true morning ſtar, that whoſoever ſhall receive light from this true Son of righteouſneſs, he cannot be deceived, but at laſt ſhall be brought to the Father of all lights.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Note is, That the Miniſters of Chriſt are in an high and honourable calling: They are figured under the types of ſtars, celeſtial lights, they have the ſame Titles of God's miniſtring ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: The Angels, they are his Meſſengers, that goes on his errants, his Ambaſſadours, to treat with man about the great myſteries of heaven. Hence ariſeth another corrolary; That all Chriſt's mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as they are ſtars, though differing from one another in glory, in parts, gifts, and graces, yet not differing in power, nor Lords over one another: They are Angels, that is, Meſſengers, Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, not Prince Cardinals, not Lord Biſhops: Every church here had its Angel, its Biſhop, its Paſtor, its Elder; not many Biſhops, not many Elders in a claſſical form over divers churches; but every church had its Angel, its Miniſters, or Officers: Epheſus had its An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gel, Smyrna its Angel, &amp;c. not that Epheſus Angel, either ſingly, o. joynt with two, three, or more, were ſuperintendent over all the reſt</p>
                  <p>Here is a farther deſcription of the terribleneſs of the appearance of Chriſt in this viſion, when he cometh in power and judgement: Out of his mouth went a ſharp two-edged ſword, and his face ſhone as the Sun in his ſtrength. The ſword of the mouth is taken in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for the words or doctrine proceeding from the mouth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 56.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Job</hi> 5.15. The word of Chriſt is here called a ſharp two-edged ſword, it cuts both ſides, but in a diverſe mode; it wounds the penitent, but for their recovery, and to bring them unto Chriſt, and ſo it is mighty in operation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. And ſecondly, It is a deſtroying ſword to his adverſaries, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Out of his mouth went a ſharp ſword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the heathen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve, Chriſt's word is very powerful, and piercing, it divides between the bone and the marrow, between the ſoul and the ſpirit; it is <hi>Telum Achilleum, Achilles</hi> Spear, that can both hurt and cure, kill and make alive.</p>
                  <p>But it may be here queſtioned, whether this figure of a two edged ſword, that went out of the mouth of Chriſt, may not ſignifie and repreſent a material ſword alſo.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer affirmatively, That Chriſt alſo is to uſe that ſword which is to ſmite the heathen with, and that is a material one, for he is to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53073:47"/>
rule them with a rod of iron, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.15. Now how it can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that Chriſt is to ſmite the heathen with the ſword of his mouth, that is, his word, or rule them with his word and doctrine, I ſee but ſmall reaſon for ſuch an interpretation; and ſeeing too, when he does this, it is in fierceneſs, treading the wine-preſs of the wrath of almighty God.</p>
                  <p>But then ſome may ſay, Does Chriſt judge and ſmite his enemies only by the material ſword?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, No; firſt he goes out with the ſword or ſpirit of his mouth, to wit, his divine truth and word, to make manifeſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, and overthrow all antichriſtian Idolatry and Worſhip, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. Then ſecondly, he goes out on the red Horſe of war, with a material ſword, to deſtroy the Beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the falſe Prophet, and their adherents; and they are ſo ſmitten and deſtroyed, that the Fowls of the Ayr are called to the prey, to eat the fleſh of kings, and the fleſh of captains, and the fleſh of mighty men, and the fleſh of horſes, and of them that ſit upon them, and the fleſh of all men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.18. and this is to be executed by the ſword that proceeded out of his mouth, v. 21. and how this can be effected by the word of his mouth, I know not, otherwiſe then by moving and working powerfully on the hearts of ſuch inſtruments as God ſhall command and employ to take the material ſword in hand, for the ruine of antichriſt, and to effect this work of wrath and judgement. Collate to this, the Notes on the two precedent verſes, 14, &amp; 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his face ſhone as the Sun ſhineth in his ſtrength.</hi>] This ſhows farther the reſplendency of this viſion, His face is likened to the Sun in his glory: There was much and great glory in this viſion, and yet all this is but like the Sun in his glory. If it were the glory of ten thouſand Suns united in one, yet would be ſhort of the eſſential glory of the Son of God; it is neither expreſſible nor comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by any of all the creatures, but here is preſented by things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath its excellency, that according to man's weakneſs, we may perceive a little of his glory; for no man yet ever could ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and live.</p>
                  <p>Hence Note, That the execution of Juſtice and Judgement, is a glorious adminiſtration. Chriſt's face ſhone as the Sun in his ſtrength, when he was about to call his delinquent and offending churches to an account for their backſlidings, in chap. 10. v. 1. &amp; 3. his face was as it were the Sun in that appearance alſo; but then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently followed thunders, and voices, as when a Lion roareth; to denote unto us, when Chriſt was going forth with terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the world, his carriage and appearance therein was moſt glorious: and it is ſaid in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.6. upon the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt in the red Sea, <hi>Thy right hand, O God, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come glorious in power, thy right hand hath daſhed in pieces the enemy, and in the greatneſs of thine excellency thou haſt overthrown them that roſe up against thee.</hi> The acts of God's power and juſtice do ſhine
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53073:48"/>
ſo clearly in the world, that they dazle mens eyes and hearts, and makes them tremble before God: So likewiſe it is amongſt the children of men, not any Magiſtrates, Commonweals, or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are more honourable, ſhining, and dreadful to their enemies, then ſuch as keep cloſe to the rules of Juſtice and judgement againſt offenders. Never was <hi>Solomon</hi> more glorious in all his reigne, then when he executed juſtice between the two Harlots, and called for the Sword to decide the controverſie. How honourable was <hi>Phineas</hi> and what a high reward he got, for executing juſtice and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? It was an old ſaying, <hi>Fiat Juſtitia, &amp; ruat Coelum.</hi> If our chief Magiſtrates keep cloſe to Juſtice in our Land and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, our Nation will ſhine as the Sun in its ſtrength, none of the Nations round about will be able to look us in the face, for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and glory of the Lord will be upon us.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53073:48"/>
blinded with it. In the Earth, Heavens, and World, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the glory of God in part, and as in a glaſs; but his eſſential glory, as it is himſelf, wherein he makes his habitation, is, that light which no man can approach to, or comprehend, and live; and therefore when it is but left out to appear but in ſome likeneſs, or ſimilitude of man; Fire, or the like, it works ſuch terrible effects upon the beholders of it. <hi>Abraham</hi> fell to the ground when he had this glory appeared to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.3.

Thirdly, It is to prepare a ſoul for entertainment of what God hath to ſpeak unto it: Our ſouls are quite out of temper by reaſon of luſts, cares, fears, and the world, to have converſe with God: This prepares them for this Divine communion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Here a queſtion may be made, whether the bleſſed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirits, Angels, or bleſſed Souls, or glorified perſons after the reſurrection, ſhall or do ſee the eſſential glory of God: Though it were granted, mortal eye cannot ſee this glory, yet thoſe bleſſed glorified creatures may?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That I am ſwayed for the negative. My reaſons are, Becauſe God's eſſential glory is himſelf, and God is inviſible, and that glory inacceſſible, and no farther, and in no other way to be ſeen and comprehended by any created being then himſelf thinks good to propound it in; and this hath hitherto from the beginning been God's method in the repreſentations of himſelf under ſhapes, figures, and ſimilitudes, fitted to the capacity of the creature: 'tis true, I confeſs Saints in heaven, and Angels, have a greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Glory of God, then Saints on earth, by reaſon of their glorified Organs, fitted to receive that high meaſure of glory, to compleat their veſſels with all true and perfect bleſſedneſs. but ſtill remember they are creatures, and will be ſtill ſo, though glorified and immortal ones; Now how a finite creature can ſee or comprehend an infinite Glory or Majeſty, I know not, otherwiſe then by condeſcenſions to their capacities, and finite natures, If a finite creature (as Angel, or glorified Saint) could ſee and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend an infinite, then what is ſeen or comprehended, it were not infinite: and if an infinite could be comprehended of the finite, the finite would it ſelf become infinite: Neither can infinite be ſeen in parts; for it is not poſſible therefore not to be ſeen at all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am of opinion, that God, and his eſſential glory, is ſeen of Angels, and glorified Saints, not as in himſelf, infinitely glorious,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53073:49"/>
but by way of condeſcenſion, in ſome reſemblance, likeneſs, figure, or repreſentation, above our reach to conſider; But I conceive the glory of God will be moſt eminently ſeen to glorified Saints, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; God did always appear in the likeneſs of the Son of man, when he did appear to his Prophets before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chriſt; the Saints ſaw God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, when he was on earth; for he was the expreſs Image of his Father: And they that hope to ſee God and his glory at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſhall ſee him moſt gloriouſly, and moſt eminently, in the face of the Son of man, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3, 4. <hi>The Throne of God and the Lamb ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, and they ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their foreheads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, Do not the Angels behold always the face of the Father in heaven? <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.10.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It is true, they are in the ſpecial preſence of God, and have a moſt high and eminent fruition and communion with God, but the manner unutterable, and inexpreſſible; for in this ſenſe you muſt underſtand it, and not literally; for God hath not a face in heaven: and conſider as before, they are creatures, and the Father is infinite and inviſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But did not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſee God, and talked with him face to face, and mouth to mouth? <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Thoſe Prophets and Patriarchs did ſee God, but how? Not eſſentially, but under divers reſemblances; for in his own nature he is inviſible: as that of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Whom no man hath ſeen, or can ſee:</hi> and that of <hi>John</hi> 1.18. is downright, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time;</hi> either by corporeal viſion, or by intellectual natural viſion, for they are weak and imperfect, and cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that which is moſt infinitely perfect in it ſelf: And for this reaſon alſo, the bleſſed celeſtial Spirits cannot comprehenſively ſee God, by reaſon of their imperfection, comparatively, to that moſt perfect Divine Being, who only is able to comprehend himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perfection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Jacob</hi> never ſaw the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nor any other; Becauſe that is pure, unmixt, and always alike, but that of God they ſaw, was under ſome reſemblance; ſomtimes of a cloud, ſomtimes of the likeneſs of fire, ſomtimes of man, &amp;c. that under the exhibition of thoſe viſible and ſenſible figures, they might perceive God, who was inviſibly repreſented to the underſtanding by theſe viſible glories.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, To ſee God face to face in Scripture, imports only two things; Firſt, a familiar converſe, as that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.4. the Lord ſpeaks to <hi>Moſes</hi> face to face, and mouth to mouth, as a friend ſpeaks with his friend. Secondly, it ſignifies a more clear ſight of God, with greater perſpicuity and clearneſs. Some ſaw God in Dreams and Viſions, which were in dark reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances; but <hi>Moſes</hi> had more clear and illuſtrious viſions of God:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53073:49"/>
To this purpoſe is that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Then ſhall we ſee face to face,</hi> that is, in heaven we ſhall enjoy and ſee God more perfectly, and more fully, then here on earth; and then we ſhall ſee God in like manner, or in ſome ſuch way as the life of man is now ſeen by the bodily eyes, by the intervention of ſomthing elſe, and ſo do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible and perceivable to the underſtanding. Jeſus Chriſt will be the great and ſpecial mirrour, wherein glorified Saints will ſee the Deity, and the Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But do not all Divines hold, that in heaven we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the beatifical viſion? And doth not that of 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. import ſo much; <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer firſt, The higheſt Saint in glory will not be able to ſee all of God in eternal life, though to ſee and know this little of God that we ſee here, is life eternal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, It is true, in heaven we ſhall ſee God in that manner, and thorow thoſe mediums he is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf in: And that we ſhall ſee him as he is, that is, as he is to be ſeen, in a new and unexpreſſible way of glory: We ſee now the Sun beams, and we ſenſibly perceive the light, efficacy, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sun, yet we cannot poſſibly behold the nature of it. In like manner, in heaven the bleſſed ſouls ſhall ſee the beams and rays of the glory of God, and ſhall live in the light and power thereof, but ſhall never comprehend the nature of it. O Lord, grant that we may ſo live here to thy glory, that in the world to come we may be partakers of thy ſelf and glory, who will then reſolve us of all our doubts, and will alſo unvail ſo much of thy ſelf unto us, as will make us moſt perfectly bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>John</hi> was in this humbled ſtate and conſternation, as dead at the feet of the glorious apparition of Chriſt, in the likeneſs of the Son of man, then he laid his right hand upon me, ſaying unto me, Fear not, I am the firſt and the laſt. The hand of the Lord hath divers ſenſes in Scripture: Firſt, for judgment, or puniſhment: <hi>The hand of the Lord ſhall be upon thee, and thou ſhalt be blind,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Elymas, Acts</hi> 13.11. Secondly, It is taken for propheſie: When God ſtirred up the ſons of men to propheſie, then it is ſaid, That <hi>the hand of the Lord was upon them:</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.3. <hi>And the hand of the Lord was upon me:</hi> that is, God ſtirred up mightily on my Spirit to Propheſie. Thirdly, It is taken for the Spirit of God, as the hand, and eſpecially the right hand, is the ſymbole of the ſtrength of man, ſo the Spirit is the ſtrength and power of the moſt High: In theſe two latter ſenſes, Chriſt lays his right hand on <hi>Iohn.</hi> Firſt, upon his conſternation, he gives him the ſpirit of Propheſie, elevates and excites <hi>John</hi>'s ſpirit to ſee Divine myſteries: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, gives him his Spirit of ſtrength, power, and conſolation, which might ſubdue all his carnal conceits and fears, and ſo remove all impediments whatſoever, that hindered him in that work which God would have him to undertake; and therefore comes in with conſolation, and bids <hi>John</hi> fear not, for I am the firſt and the laſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:53073:50"/>From this, Note.</p>
                  <p>That thoſe that are ſtrucken low, and humbled by God, are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to be riſen by God for the reception of his choiceſt divine truths and myſteries. <hi>John</hi> was ſtrucken as dead with his glory, and then heard a voice, Fear not, but write the things that thou ſhalt ſee, to the ſeven Churches. When the Prophets <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were fallen down on their faces, then they were lifted by the Spirit, and received glorious viſions: We muſt let all our own go, our falſe confidences, and carnal props, as of our own parts, our graces, our eminency in gifts, and the like, if we will be fit auditors for Chriſt; we muſt fall down at the feet of his Throne, if we expect an anſwer from his Throne. <hi>Moſes</hi> a meek man, yea the meekeſt of all men, he received the choiceſt favours from God's hand; for he ſpake to him mouth to mouth, and face to face. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He laid his right hand upon me, ſaying unto me, fear not.</hi> Hence ſecondly Note,</p>
                  <p>That the hand of Chriſt, or his Spirit, is not only a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, but alſo a comforting and conſolating Spirit. This is the Comforter, that takes off all fears from <hi>Iohn:</hi> It is the Spirit of God that does convince, it is the Spirit of God that converts; it is the Spirit that doth inſpire godly men, it is the Spirit that ſanctifies, it is the Spirit that comforts, the Spirit is the great Agent, and hand of God, by which God doth all his works. Chriſt here in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Son of man, was but as a terrible apparition unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> it ſerved only to ſtrike him dead, before he laid his right hand upon him, to comfort and ſupport him: ſo the ſight or knowledge of Chriſt in the Goſpel, without the co-operation of his holy Spirit, is but as a terrible ſight and knowledge, that makes for the greater condemnation: Chriſt unto ſome may be a rock of offence, and a ſtumbling ſtone, whiles unto others that have his Spirit, he is the rock of ſalvation, and the corner ſtone, which is ſure and precious. O lay thy right hand, O Lord, upon thy ſervant, give him thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that he may know thy Will and minde in thy Word, and ſerve thee without fear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. That Chriſt is full of bowels of grace and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, towards all ſuch as he ſmites and humbles. The ſight of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory being the moſt effectual thing unto poor, frail, worthleſs creatures, God follows it with the greateſt comfort, and ſweeteſt conſolations. No ſooner does Chriſt appear unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that makes him fall at his feet as dead, but preſently Chriſt lays his right hand upon him, and he hears his comforting word, ſaying, Fear not: Chriſt would not leave <hi>Iohn</hi> in that ſpiritleſs and liveleſs condition, that the glory of the Viſion had affected him with, but quickly raiſes him, and comforts him again, with the moſt effectual and ſweeteſt conſolations. Chriſt is our merciful high Prieſt, and that good compaſſionate Samaritane, who is ſo affected and touched with our wounds and infirmities, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.33. <hi>Heb</hi> 4.15. and that more eſpecially, with ſuch hurts and wounds that proceeds
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53073:50"/>
from his own hand, that he is moſt ready at hand with the oyl and wine, the Grace of his Goſpel, and Blood of his Covenant, to pour into our wounded ſouls, for peace, healing, and conſolation. <hi>Job</hi> after he was ſtricken and humbled by the hand of God, and came to a true ſight of the hand that did it, <hi>His captivity is turned into joy, and comforts are multiplyed,</hi> Job 42.5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>Daniel</hi> after he was afflicted, and humbled for his own ſins, and the ſins of his forefathers, cap. 4. <hi>Then the Lord ſent Gabriel to comfort him, and to tell him, that he was a man greatly beloved,</hi> ver. 22. God does not throw down, afflict, wound, or humble any of his ſervants, to leave them ſo; but forthwith, or within a ſhort time, reaches out his right hand, and lays it upon them, to raiſe them up, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. Another Note from this comforting word of Chriſt, ſaying, <hi>Fear not,</hi> is; That the Word of Chriſt being conjunct with the Hand of Chriſt, his Spirit is the moſt effectual comfort to a wounded ſpirit. The Word without the Spirit is inefficacious in its operations; <hi>John</hi> had lain ſtill as a ſenſleſs and dead perſon, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the word and voice of Chriſt, if he had not lain his hand upon him alſo: The word is of little power, if the efficacy of the Spirit be not in it; without this it is but a dead letter: That word of Chriſt which is powerful and efficacious, carries the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with it; the ſame word goes forth unto all, and works from common gifts in ſome; ſo many are called: But that that makes it a diſtinguiſhing powerful word, is the concomitancy of the Spirit of grace; and ſo, few are choſen. When therefore we find in Scriptures ſuch expreſſions, as that the Word is <hi>the incorruptible ſeed, the power of God to ſalvation, the word of life, ſharper then a two-edged ſword,</hi> and the like: Theſe, and the like phraſes, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, not as if the Word were ſuch in it ſelf without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but conjunctively, when the Word is made the chariot of the Spirit, and the Spirit is made the life and power of the Word. The Word without the Spirit, is only a voice void of vertue and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Spirit without the medium of the Word, works not ordinarily, but both conjunct together, makes up that true diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel, which is called the miniſtration of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. and the Grace of God that brings ſalvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. God is light it ſelf, and the Father of lights; yet the Sun is not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but by it he enlightens us: ſo the Spirit of God is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, and the Sanctifier, but does both comfort, ſanctifie, and perform all other his offices and works, in, by, and through the Word. O Lord, ſanctifie and comfort us by thy Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for thy Word is Truth, and the power of our God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. The laſt Note that I ſhall raiſe from theſe words, <hi>And he laid his right hand upon me, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall be, That Chriſt doth fully furniſh in ſome good meaſure, with the gifts and graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, all ſuch as he calls and employs in the great offices of his church.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53073:51"/>
Firſt, he lays his right hand upon <hi>John,</hi> intimating his deſignation, enſtalment, and confirmation in his Prophetical office: for, as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands was the ſolemn, and the ultimate compleat act in Ordination, unto all Offices in the Church, ſo Chriſt here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his own method uſed in his churches; he lays his right hand upon him: but here lies the difference; men may lay their hands on, that is, beſtow offices on men, but cannot add power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thoſe offices; but Chriſt not only lays his hand on, makes <hi>John</hi> a Prophet, but fils him with his Spirit alſo. Whom Chriſt calls unto offices in his church, he lays his right hand upon them, he fills them with his Spirit. <hi>John</hi> before he received his confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Prophetical office, and the command to write his viſions, and what he ſaw, unto the churches; had in the firſt place, divine viſions of Chriſt in the likeneſs of the Son of man, and was ſtruck as dead with the glory thereof; whereupon Chriſt laid his hand of comfort upon him, and he heard that rouſing voice, ſaying, <hi>Fear not:</hi> The caſe and condition of ſuch perſons that are called to the Miniſterial offices in the church, ſhould in ſome meaſure run para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with <hi>Iohn</hi>'s. Firſt, They ought to have clear viſions of Chriſt, ſound knowledge in the myſteries of the Goſpel. Secondly, under the apprehenſion of divine glory and their own corruption, they ought to be humble, and lie low at the feet of Chriſt, to be pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns unto others in humility, ſelf-denial, and other graces. Thirdly, They ought to be ſenſible of Chriſts hand upon them; that is, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which will manifeſt it ſelf in their ſanctified deſires, willingneſs and readineſs unto the work of the Lord. Fourthly and laſtly, They ought to hear that rouſing word of comfort within; Fear not: that is, the comfortable experience of the Spirit in their own ſouls, Fear not, which will raiſe them to a holy confidence, to declare the mind of God in all things, and not to fear the faces of men; for <hi>the righteous are as bold as a Lion.</hi> This endowment with the Spirit, was that that was principally looked at in the chuſing of Officers, in the Acts of the Apoſtles, yea even Officers of the loweſt form. Conſult <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3. and 9.17.11.24. and 13.2. unleſs men have the Spirit of Chriſt in them in ſome fulneſs of it, they are neither fit for thoſe holy functions, nor can ſatisfyingly perſwade themſelves or others, that they are called of God unto them.</p>

                  <p>That this perſon that is here ſpoken of, was Chriſt, is clear; to avoid repetitions, peruſe the precedent 8 and 13 verſes: but here lies the difficulty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It was formerly aſſerted on verſ. 13. that this was the divine perſon of Chriſt that appeared unto <hi>Iohn</hi> in the form of a man; now according to his divine nature, he is impaſſible, he did not ſuffer death, nor was again made alive, for he is life it ſelf;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53073:51"/>
therefore this is only proper to his humanity, and that was it, to wit, his humane nature, that appeared unto <hi>Iohn;</hi> that which was now alive, and was dead.</p>
                  <p>To clear this, I anſwer, you muſt underſtand that is frequent in Scripture, to attribute that unto one nature, which is the proper attribute of the other; and ſo as the Learned calls it, <hi>communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Idiomatum,</hi> by the communication of properties, what is due unto the divine nature, is communicated, or attributed unto the humane, and ſo on the contrary: as to inſtance, When we are ſaid to be bought, juſtified, or ſaved by the blood of God; wherein we muſt not be ſo groſs, to conceive that God hath blood, but it is meant of that perſon who cleanſed us by his blood, was both Man and God in one perſon; and that which is proper to the humane nature, is here attributed unto the divine: And ſo when it is ſaid that God ſuffered, and the Son of man created all things, and 'twas he that was with the Father from everlaſting: This is predicated of one nature, which is proper to the other. Conſult <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</p>
                  <p>And ſo in this verſe, though it is ſaid, that Chriſt in his divine perſon appeared unto <hi>John,</hi> under the ſimilitude of the Son of man, who is alive, but was dead, imports only thus much; That that ſimilitude or form that appeared unto <hi>John,</hi> was the very ſame Chriſt, and Divine Perſon, that was conjunct with his humanity in heaven, and by a mutual and interchangeable communication, and attribution of properties, this divine Idea, or Repreſentation, that <hi>John</hi> ſaw, is called by the proper attribution of Chriſt's hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, which was pierced, dead, and lived again; though indeed it was only the diuine perſon of Chriſt, clothed with the figure and likeneſs of the Son of man, which was dead, but was now alive. This is very uſual in Scripture, and amongſt Divines, wherein the properties of one nature are really attributed to the perſon denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated of the other nature interchangeably, by reaſon of the unity of perſon conſiſting in both natures.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, That oft in Scripture that hath the real de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of a thing, which is only ſo in appearance and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. That apparition, or counterfeit of <hi>Samuel</hi> that appeared unto <hi>Saul</hi> at the Witch of Endors, is called <hi>Samuel</hi> ſeveral times in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. without any note of diſtinction from the true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> further then is collected from ſcriptural reaſon and the coherence of the diſcourſe in that place: Angels that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the form and likeneſs of men to <hi>Jacob, Lot,</hi> &amp;c. are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led men, becauſe they appeared in humane form: ſo this divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt here, is called the ſame perſon that was dead, but is now alive; becauſe he appeared in that ſhape and figure of the Son of man, which was dead, but is now alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And behold I am alive for evermore, Amen.</hi> As he is the firſt and the laſt, the firſt before all beginnings, and the laſt to all eternity, ſo Chriſt aſſures all his in this place, he is the ſame for ever to them, a King to rule and protect them, a Mediator to intercede for them,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53073:52"/>
a Prophet, to teach and direct them unto everlaſting, Amen, ſo be it, ſo it ſhall be, and ſo it muſt be. And he adds,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I have the Keys of hell and death.</hi>] Chriſt to take off all fear from <hi>John,</hi> and to aſſure <hi>John,</hi> and all his Saints, that he is moſt powerful, and able to effect and bring to paſs thoſe viſions and pte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that he was about to reveal unto <hi>John,</hi> and by him unto his churches, he now publiſheth unto <hi>John,</hi> that all power now is put into his hand from the Father, even over hell it ſelf, for he hath deſpoiled it of its power: Here is a tranſporting of the word hell before death: Hell is the ſting of death, and therefore according to order of things, the laſt: <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. ſo death and hell were caſt into the Lake of fire. Take hell here for the grave, or the ſtate of the dead: ſo Chriſt hath the key to open it in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; ſo hath power to deliver them from the ſtate of death and hell. Or ſecondly, Take death and hell for the ſtate of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he hath power over that too; he holds the key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1. as he hath obtained power ſince his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to give Crowns and Thrones to all his faithful ones, that ſhall perſevere and overcome; ſo alſo to chaſtiſe his impenitent and obſtinate adverſaries with hell and death. The Keys in Scripture do ſignifie Power, Dominion, and Rule: He that keeps and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the keys of a City, hath the Power and Rule over it: The Keys were anciently carried before the chief Magiſtrate, and are in ſome places at this preſent time, as ſymbols and badges of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. On <hi>Peter</hi>'s honourable confeſſion in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. the Keys of the Kingdom of heaven is given unto him by Chriſt, which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the power of ſhutting and looſing, which was by Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the Church. It is ſaid in the third chapter, that <hi>Chriſt hath the key of David, that ſhutteth, and no man openeth; and openeth, and no man ſhutteth:</hi> and in chap. 20. v. 1. Chriſt is there repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Angel that had the key of the bottomleſs pit. All this connotes,</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That Chriſt hath the full power over all powers, and principalities of darkneſs, over the divel, and death, and hell it ſelf, which before he hath attained and purchaſed by his death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they cannot move nor ſtir to the deſtruction of ſouls, but as he permits them; it is a moſt vain conceit, yea, and ſavours of little faith, in thoſe that think that the godly, or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones of Chriſt, are in the hands of Divels or Witches, to be hurt by them, or tormented at their pleaſures: Chriſt hath the Keys of hell and death, the wicked Angels are ſo ſurely locked in their priſons, and reſerved in chains up by his providence, that they cannot poſſibly touch any one of thoſe that are dear to God, no not to hurt a hair of their head, or the leaſt lamb in their fold, without Chriſt's ſpecial commiſſion for it; and then too, they are like a dog in a chain, under his hand and direction, to go thus far, and no farther: The Divel could not touch <hi>Iob,</hi> who was hedged about by God, before he bid him go: And therefore, O! How reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53073:52"/>
and weak it is to affirm or hold, that they are in the Divel's power, to touch or hurt at his pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whom Chriſt hath ſaid down his moſt precious blood, and are as dear unto him, as the apple of his eye; but if at any time God ſhall give any of his into the hand of Satan, to be touched by him, either in perſon or goods, let us conſider, it is either to withdraw and wean us from ſin, and to bring us to repentance for it, or elſe to winnow and try us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will bleſs the name of God or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In ſuch caſes, which ſeldom God exerciſes his children under, for few are able to bear ſuch temptations, and God will lay no more on his, then they are able to bear; the moſt high and eminent in grace, are only fit to meet with ſuch ſtrong tryals, and not ſink under them, as <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> whom Satan buffetted; but if God ſhall uſe the hand of Satan, to ſmite any of his children, let them look upon God as the principal Mover, and Author of it; and though Satan be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, yet to ſay with wiſe and godly <hi>Iob,</hi> The Lord hath done it; <hi>The Lord taketh, and the Lord giveth, Bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. Another obſervation hence is, That Chriſt's obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enemies, according to the Propheſies in this Book, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and look for a moſt ſure and certain ruine and deſtruction. For here Chriſt ſays unto <hi>Iohn, Fear thou not Iohn,</hi> that is, of the truth and execution of thoſe dreadful predictions, and judiciary viſions, which I ſhall now make known unto thee, concerning thoſe high, implacable, and obſtinate enemies of mine; they may think I have not power to execute thoſe judgements upon them, but they ſhall know, that I have the keys of hell and death, that Satan is at my command and beck, to be the executioner of my wrath upon them, and that I have power to open the door of hell, death, and deſtruction, and to ſhut them up, together with Satan, in that Lake of fire, that burneth with fire and brimſtone for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. and 20.10.</p>
                  <p>Hence two Uſes ariſe very naturally. Firſt, That the godly need not fear hell nor death, either that of the grave, or that of the ſecond death; for Chriſt their head is the Key-keeper of both, and hath power thereof.</p>
                  <p>Next, Let the impenitent, wicked, and ſuch as will not have Chriſt to reigne over them, fear and tremble; for he has the keys of hell and death: Therefore repent in time, and kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, before the day come, wherein he ſhall ſhut, and no man openeth.</p>

                  <p>After Chriſt had fitted and confirmed <hi>John</hi> in his Prophetical Office, by laying his hand upon him, and by giving his Spirit to him, and aſſuring him, that it was he that is the firſt and the laſt, that is alive, but was dead, and had the power over hell and death, moſt able and mighty therefore to bring to paſs, and execute all the dreadful predictions and viſions which Chriſt ſhould make known unto him, and being thus qualified and confirmed, he receives his commiſſion to write the things that he had ſeen, and the things which are; that is, to Record theſe things which he had ſeen, and were repreſented to him, by, and in the precedent viſions, which relate unto things that are preſent, and in being; to wit, God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his will and judgements, towards the famous ſeven Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an churches, ſome whereof had much back-ſlidden from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity, which the firſt, ſecond, and third chapters do treat of, as things that were then preſent, and in being. Next, <hi>Iohn</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write the things which ſhall come after; that is, he is to record viſions and things which he ſhall ſee, which are related unto the future.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Hence Note, That this book of Propheſies is not only a Hiſtorical relation and diſcovery, under hyerogliphick figures of things preſent, but alſo of things to come: <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded to write to the then ſeven Aſian churches, and that as an Introduction to all the future Propheſies; and this is that that is intimated in cap. 5. v. 1. where a book is repreſented, written within and without; within, that is, ſecret, ſealed under ſeven Seals, and their end yet in part to come: written without, that is, plain for diſcovery, open to the view: All which imports, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was to write of the then preſent ſtate of Affairs, and of the churches, which was plain and open, and as of things that are: and alſo of the future ſtate of things, which are as a book written within, ſealed and ſecret, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their futurity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Note hence is, That God's true Prophets, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters, will commend no more to the obſervation of their churches, as viſions from God, then what they have really ſeen, and hath been diſcovered from God unto them: They are not to come with the word of the Lord in their mouth, and pretend viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from God, like the falſe prophets in <hi>Ier.</hi> 14, whiles their mouths and hearts are full of lying vanities. <hi>Iohn</hi> writes no more then what he ſaw to the ſeven churches, nor diſcovers no more then what he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53073:53"/>
ſaw was then preſent, or ſhould come to paſs in after time. <hi>What we haue ſeen and heard,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we ſpeak, and are bold to preach, and to commend unto you.</hi> Chriſt's Miniſters ſhould preſs no more then what they are aſſured are experienced truths: I doubt me, every opinion concerning outward forms of Government, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the like, will not at laſt appear to be viſions of God, which ſome do now a days ſo hotly contend for, it may be one day ſaid unto ſuch hot-ſpurs. <hi>Boanerges,</hi> ſons of Thunder: who requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch things at your hands? whiles you let the greateſt works, as of love, righteouſneſs, and judgement, lie proſtrate at your feet, as if they did not concern you.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>The myſterie of the ſeven Stars, &amp;c.</hi>] Chriſt in the laſt verſe, to make things plain unto <hi>John,</hi> and to give him a taſte of the diſcovery of thoſe myſteries in his book, interprets the myſtery of the viſion of ſeven Stars, and of the ſeven Candleſticks, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto his ſight in the precedent 12 and 16 verſes, and he calls it, the myſterie of ſeven Stars and candleſticks; becauſe indeed unto <hi>John</hi> it was a ſecret and hidden thing, what thoſe figures of ſtars and candleſticks did myſtically mean or repreſent; and unto <hi>John</hi> it would be ſtill a myſterie, if Chriſt himſelf had not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>That this book of Revelations is made clear, obvious, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, by a diligent obſervation, and a right applicationof the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical characters and figures of each viſion: Chriſt himſelf in this verſe, hath made the firſt enterance and eſſay on this account: He tells us, that the ſeven Stars in his right hand, and the ſeven golden candleſticks, do myſtically repreſent the ſeven Angels, or Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of his churches, and the ſeven candleſticks, the churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In the ſeventeenth chapter Chriſt is more large in interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the myſterie of Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, &amp;c. All which connotes unto us,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the wiſe obſervant chriſtian, may attain unto the revelation and diſcovery of the myſteries of this book of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies by the help of the Spirit of God, upon a diligent enquiry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into: The Spirit ſays often in the ſecond and third chapters, <hi>Let him that hath an ear; hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches:</hi> and in chap. 13. verſ. 18. <hi>Here is wiſdom, let him that hath wit count the number: Here is the mind that hath wiſdom,</hi> cap. 17. v. 9. ſo that it is for him that hath an ear, an intelligent underſtanding ear, and wiſdom, a wiſe heart to conſider, that is fit and capable to open and apply aright the myſteries of this book: It is a myſtery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore difficult to all, but unto the ſpiritualized eye, and unto the mind, that hath wiſdom; but it ſhould not therefore be accounted preſumption in ſuch, to undertake this eſſay, ſeeing it hath pleaſed Chriſt to give us the firſt fruits himſelf, in opening the myſteries of the viſion of the ſeven ſtars, and the ſeven golden candleſticks, which is as an enterance into the whole; and ſince he hath interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us, that by the ſeven ſtars are meant the ſeven Angels of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53073:54"/>
the churches; by the ſeven golden candleſticks, the ſeven famous Aſian churches; by the woman arrayed in ſcarlet, the mother of harlots in the ſeventeenth of the Revelations, to be the great City that reigneth over the Kings of the earth; and the Beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns, to ſignifie a Government, Empire, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on ſeven Mountains, where the great harlot reigneth under ten Kings; why ſhould it be thought ſtrange, raſh, or preſumptuous, to interpret the reſt of the myſtical figures, and hyeroglyphick cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of this book, according to their natural and genuine tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and as they are opened and applyed in other prophetical wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, by one and the ſame Spirit of Propheſie; whoſe wiſdom it was ever from the beginning, to repreſent the riſings, progreſs, and downials of the great Empires and Kingdoms of the word, by ſuch dark and myſterious figures and repreſentations, unto God's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, his Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And conceive one great reaſon of this dark and myſterious carriage of the Spirit, is, That the Intendments of God towards the Powers and Kingdoms of the world, may be revealed and made known but unto few, ſuch as have ſpirits ſutable, and wills to conform to the will of God in all things; for if thoſe great events, and revolutions of State were made vulgar, and known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all, it would raiſe innumerable combuſtions in the world, and great ſufferings and afflictions to the children of God, from thoſe Powers that they live under, for whoſe ſakes theſe great concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſubverſions of States and Kingdoms do come to paſs, that Chriſt's and their Intereſt may be exalted at the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Note. That it is the Spirit of Chriſt in his Word, that makes known, and opens the ſecrets of all Divine myſteries unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Chriſt diſcovers unto <hi>John</hi> thoſe myſteries of ſtars, &amp;c. It is this Spirit that ſearcheth into the deep things of God: He ſhall take of mine (as Chriſt ſaith, John 16.15. and ſhall ſhow it unto you: and hence he is called the Comforter; becauſe he makes the love of the Father, and the grace of Chriſt, which was before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand hid in the boſome and counſel of God, manifeſt unto poor ſouls, and ſo ſheds abroad the love of God in their hearts by faith. The diſcovery of Divine myſteries, are too high a work for the ableſt and wiſeſt perſon in his natural capacity, without the help of Chriſt's Spirit; for they are ſpiritually, not carnally to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, The myſterie of the ſeven ſtars, Chriſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets to be the Angels of the ſeven churches. Stars in all propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writings, do ſignifie perſons of eminency and honour; and in Heraldry, it is accounted the moſt noble ſort of blazoning, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar alone to the Armory of Princes. The Angels of the ſeven chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or rather Meſſengers, for ſo the Greek word ſignifies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come with the beſt meſſage and news that ever came to man; to wit, the glad tydings of peace through Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore beautiful are their feet, and ſo may rightly be repreſented myſtically or figuratively by thoſe lightſome and noble creatures,

                  <p>And the myſtery of the ſeven golden Candleſticks, Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets to be the ſeven Churches; to wit, in <hi>Epheſ, Smyrna, Pergamus,</hi> &amp;c.

That he appeared in the midſt of them, in great luſter, glory, and ſplendour. Golden Candleſticks are fit Types and Emblemes to repreſent Chriſt's churches: Firſt, In reſpect of their choiceſt mettal; they are golden Candleſticks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Chriſt's churches are of that precious allay and temper, that they excel all other aſſemblies in the world. Others of the world, though never ſo great and eminent, are but as Lead or Tin, but thoſe like precious gold. Secondly, Gold is the moſt tryed and refined mettal that is; ſo are Chriſt's churches, they go under ſeven fold refinements: They have tryals from God and man: Refinements by afflictions, refinements by the Spirit of Grace, whereby their droſs is done away, and ſo become moſt precious and ſhining gold. Thirdly, Gold is the moſt noble, deareſt, and higheſt eſteemed mettal amongſt men, ſo Chriſts churches are the moſt highly reſpected by God of all creatures, the world was made for their ſakes, yea they are the right heirs, that is, that have the more eſpecial right, by bleſſing, promiſe, and compact, unto the world, and the good things thereof, whether things preſent, or things to come; why, all is yours, if Chriſt be yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. Fourthly, It is the moſt extenſive and ductible of all mettals; ſo Chriſt's churches they have the largeſt bowels of true charity of any ſort of people in the world, for they will endeavour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and pray for it, even of their very enemies. Fifthly, Gold is the moſt weighty of all mettals: Chriſt's churches are of the greateſt weight with God, all others are but as the duſt of the ballance in compariſon of them; they are of ſuch weight with God, that they are to ſtand in the gap, to ſtay the hand of God when he goes out to execute his judgements: If two or three righteous perſons be in a City, God will not deſtroy it for their ſakes. Sixthly, and laſtly, Gold is moſt fair and ſhining of all mettals: ſo Chriſt's churches, they are moſt ſhining in their graces, they are not guilded Candleſticks, but golden ones; yea beaten ones, as that of the Tabernacle was. <hi>Thou art all fair,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Spouſe in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. <hi>my Love, behold thou art fair, behold thou art fair, like a Lilly among the Thorns, ſo is my Love among the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Cant. 2.2.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, conſider the Types and Figures; the ſeven
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53073:55"/>
Candleſticks that are the emblemes of thoſe ſeven Churches, and how they ſuit fitly for this purpoſe, all know; The proper work of Candleſticks is to contain and hold their ſhining lamps or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.37. <hi>And thou ſhalt make the ſeven Lamps there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Lamps thereof ſhalt thou put thereon, to give light toward that that is before it.</hi> As the golden Candleſtick of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was to have ſeven lamps or lights, to give light to all that was before it, ſo theſe ſeven golden Candleſticks, thoſe ſeven Aſian churches, have their ſeven Lamps or lights therein, which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber denotes perfection, to enlighten all that was before it: they have alſo their ſeven Angels, ſeven faithful Meſſengers, Miniſters, or Ambaſſadors of Chriſt's Word and Truth, to enlighten every ſoul that comes with a teachable heart before them. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That every church of Chriſt, as the candleſtick of the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.37. ought to have their ſhining Lamps in them; that is, Miniſters and Teachers that are both godly and faithful ones: Each one of the ſeven Aſian churches had its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, its light, its Lamp within its candleſtick: and a church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe lights, theſe Angels, is as a candleſtick without its lamp, or light, ſtanding for ornament and faſhion ſake, but wanting much of its honour, life, light, and ſervice, which thoſe Lamps and lights would yeild unto it; for Chriſt hath placed in his church ſome Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Prophets, ſome Teachers, ſome Paſtors, ſome Elders, and all for the edifying and compleating of his Body, the church. Churches thus organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with their Angels and Miniſters, are moſt comly: yea that high expreſſion in <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.4. may be well applyed to ſuch, <hi>Thou art beautiful, O my Love, as Tirza, comly as Jeruſalem, terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi> Amidſt thoſe ſeven golden candleſticks that had their Angels or Lamps ſhining within them, Chriſt made his glorious appearance in the likeneſs of the Son of man, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. The diſcoveries of Chriſt's ways and preſence, both in the way of grace and judgement, are moſt clearly to be learn'd and diſcern'd amongſt his churches, that have their Angels, Miniſters, and Teachers ſhining moſt bright in their life and doctrine, in the midſt amongſt them; and like to this, was the advice which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had given to the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> chap. 1.7, 8. when ſhe had loſt, or could not find her Beloved: <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my ſoul loveth! where thou feedeſt? Where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at Noon?</hi> His anſwer is, <hi>If thou know not, thou faireſt among women! Go thy way forth by the footſteps of the flock, and feed thy Kids beſide the Shepherds Tents.</hi> Therefore, O thou the beloved of my ſoul, cauſe my ſoul, that by its wandrings have long miſſed thee, to ſeek for thee among thy golden candleſticks, in thy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and holy Aſſemblies, in the midſt whereof thou doſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that my ſoul which languiſheth, may be comforted with Apples, and ſtayed with Flaggons (with ſpiritual comforts and refreſhments) from thy ſelf, who dwelleſt in the gardens, and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy flocks beſide the Shepherds Tents.</p>

                     </gap>, or Chriſt, God-Man, who gave theſe Divine Revelations unto <hi>John,</hi> ſome immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſome by his miniſtring Spirits, the Angels; for though the greateſt part of theſe Propheſies are given and ſignified by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality of Angels, yet it may be truly ſaid, that Chriſt doth it; for it is a known rule, What is done by another at ones Order and command, is done by himſelf: Chriſt he is the Author of thoſe Viſions, he gives them out to <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> he is the recipient inſtrument, and the ſubordinate Author, and is commanded to write them, and make them known unto the churches; and in the firſt place in this ſecond and third chapters, <hi>John</hi> is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, to write thoſe premonitions to the ſeven churches, which in their order ſhall be handled: But in the way, before I fall upon the particulars, it will be worth the enquiry,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why <hi>John</hi> is commanded particularly to write to each church of the ſeven apart: <hi>To the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, of the Church of Smyrna, of the Church of Pergamus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, for divers reaſons: Firſt, They were not guilty of one and the ſame faults; and as their defections were divers and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo ought they to have various and divers reprehenſions: So likewiſe their graces and endowments were various, ſo ought they to have divers and various encouragements therein: The more obdurate and high-handed ſinners, ought to have the ſharpeſt and higheſt reproofs and cenſures, but the more flexible and tender-hearted, ought to be dealt with the more tender hand of love and compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſeveral charges are drawn againſt each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular church, and ſo ſent unto them by the hand of their own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Angel, Miniſter, or Paſtor, to ſhew unto us, that they were not to ſeek for any extrinſecal power or authority over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Chriſt is the common and general admonitor and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hender of them all; each of them are ſolely and ſingly under his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53073:56"/>
reprehenſive power and juriſdiction. The Angel of the church of Epheſus hath only received commands and reproofs, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the church of Epheſus; ſo the Angel of Smyrna, for the church of Smyrna, and the Angel of Pergamus, for the church of Pergamus, &amp;c. The Angel of the church of Epheſus did not receive commands or reproofs, to impoſe them juridically on the church of Smyrna, nor Smyrna on the church of Pergamus, or on any one of the ſeven, either ſingly by it ſelf, or joyntly with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the others, one, two, or more: They were not to be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents, or to have a prelatical authority over the reſt; there was no cathedral then at Epheſus, nor in any of the other ſix: the name of Archiepiſcopacy and Hierarchycal Supremacy, was then unknown in the little well-ordered Chriſtian world, or rather Common-weal; Biſhops then did look no farther with an eye of authority, then over their own flocks; neither then was it known that a combination of ſome few churches, or rather officers of churches, under the name of claſſical Elders, provincial Elders, or National Elders, ſhould have the ſole power and juriſdiction over the reſt of the churches of Chriſt in their vicinity: Epheſus then as unto outward authority, was Independent, Smyrna then was Independent, and ſo were all the reſt: The churches could then, and alſo now can act conſultatively, by way of advice, by their Elders and Brethren, either joynt or ſingly, but not juridically, by way of authority, over one and another: The churches of Chriſt are all Peers, reſpecting their authority, yet in their graces and perfections amongſt themſelves differing from one and another in glory: Chriſt keeps the ſole Legiſlative power in his own hand, and what he communicates thereof unto his churches, it is not that they ſhould be lords over their Siſter-churches faith, but that they may within their due bounds, exerciſe their wholſome admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cenſures, according to the Word of God: Chriſt will not ſuffer one church juridically to cenſure another ſiſter-church, though corrupt, for there is no ſuch authority given them; Chriſt keeps that prerogative in his own hand, he reproves and cenſures the whole ſeven Aſian churches himſelf, but ſuffers not one or more to do it over the reſt: And one great reaſon of this is, That if Chriſt had granted ſuch authority unto one church over others, that that church which becomes moſt potent, and moſt countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſecular powers, though moſt corrupted in doctrine and worſhip, will undertake to cenſure the ſoundeſt and moſt orthodox churches of all; as the Arrians did of old in the times of the ſons of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, and their Succeſſors, cenſure, chaſtiſe, and vex even the ſoundeſt and moſt faithful churches of Chriſt: And the idolatrous apoſtatized church of Rome, under this pretence of having authority over other churches, do even fulminate out her direſt Anathemas on all other churches, though the faithful and undefiled ſpouſes of Chriſt: Be wiſe therefore ye true ſpouſes of Chriſt, hold faſt the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53073:57"/>
free, leſt ye ſubjugate your necks, and precious faith, unto the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries of the ſpiritual harlot: For this very reaſon Chriſt gives his particular cenſures and reproofs to each particular church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their peculiar failings and errours, that one more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt church might not undertake to cenſure that which was leſs corrupt: But if it be demanded how a ſound and faithful church of Chriſt ſhould carry it ſelf towards an erroneous and backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den corrupted church, I anſwer, They are to uſe all means for their recovery, and that in love and charity: Firſt, They are to adviſe them, and admoniſh them of the danger of their ways, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably, not juridically, as a church exerciſes towards her own members. Secondly, They are to pray for their healing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery out of their ſpiritual Maladies. If all this will not do, to their amendment, they are to withdraw communion from them, and to leave them to their Maſter, who after he hath proceeded on his white horſe, with offers of peace and reconciliation, and they continue obſtinate, and not turn by repentance, he can go forth on his red Horſe of wrath and fury, and remove his candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, his church, and the glory thereof, from amongſt them, and leave them deſolate. The firſt that I read of that extended the wings of his authority beyond his own juſt limits and bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, was <hi>Victor,</hi> Biſhop of Rome, about the end of the ſecond century, who hotly contended with <hi>Ireneus,</hi> and others of the Affrican churches, to have a Supremacy over them, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Dictates on them, and that very pertinaciouſly, about a frivolous controverſie, the obſervation of Eaſter. Herein that myſterie of Iniquity did begin to work, which in few after ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, came to its full ſtature. To this I ſhall only add, that all ancient and modern hiſtory, both civil and eccleſiaſtique, do teſtifie, that this Prelacy, and affecting of Supremacy over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches, whether it be in one ſingle church, perſon, or many combined ones, hath not only been very dangerous and prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the faithful churches of Chriſt, but is, and hath been always the very firſt born of pride and luxury.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another reaſon is, that Chriſt writes particularly to each of the ſeven churches, is, to ſhew, That Chriſt hath an equal care and reſpect to all his churches, whiles they continue his, though under foul prevarications and backſlidings: Chriſt hath bowels of compaſſion towards them, as long as they keep faithful to his name, though otherwiſe in themſelves very faulty; and he is found to be walking in the midſt of them providentially, caring for them, holding the ſeven Stars in his right hand, and teaching them by his Word, if ſo be he may bring them to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Theſe meſſages are directed to each particular church, out of Chriſts eſpecial tenderneſs towards them, that they might endeavour to reform their enormities within and amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, That the churches errours and infirmities may not be told in Gath, nor publiſhed abroad to their reproach amongſt their
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53073:57"/>
enemies; whilſt there is any hope of the recovery of backſliders, Chriſt comes with a rod and ſtrokes of a loving and tender heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed father, to cure them, not to ſhame and reproach them; and therefore Chriſt directs <hi>John</hi> to write his meſſages to the Angels of each particular church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, Write,</hi>] What is meant by Angel, I refer to the ſixteenth and laſt verſes of the firſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter: But the queſtion is, Whether by Angel of the church, of Epheſus, be intended the chief Paſtor or Biſhop, being as Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent, or Archbiſhop over the reſt of the Biſhops and Paſtors of the church of Epheſus? Or, Whether the Angel of Epheſus were the Metropolitan over the other ſix Siſter churches?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer firſt to the latter, There is no colour at all for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, for the reaſons but in the former page ſpecified; and to add a word, Becauſe Chriſt commands each Angel to reform their abuſes within themſelves: He ſends not the Angel of one church to reform another, that has no authority over it; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the church of Epheſus is not ſent to Smyrna, nor Smyrna unto Epheſus, nor unto the reſt, but an extraordinary Officer, a Prophet, <hi>John,</hi> a man of God is ſent unto them all, to tell them of their faults, and to exerciſe that authority which Chriſt hath given and depoſited in all his Goſpel churches, and to each of them in particular, for their dealings and recoveries out of their backſlidings. Indeed any one that hath an extraordinary Spirit and call, as <hi>John</hi> had, may exerciſe that unlimited authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the churches of Chriſt, but I know not any in theſe days, or ſince the Apoſtles times, that do pretend unto it, but that great and rampant Roman man of ſin, who is the great and only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender to that Spirit of Infallibility, and yet who more fallible then himſelf in his judicial ſentences, doctrines, and ways of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Indeed if he had what he pretends, that Spirit of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity juſtly might he aſſume authority in cenſuring, directing, and governing all other churches; but before that does appear, let himſelf, and others that aſſumes the like authority with himſelf, hide their faces in ſhame and confuſion for ever.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To the firſt queſtion I anſwer, That thoſe I confeſs of the Epiſcopal Intereſts, do hold that the Superſcription of the particular church, directed to the Angel of the churches of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Smyrna, &amp;c. do intend and ſignifie, that they are directed to the chief Paſtor or Biſhop, that is ſupream Overſeer, Director, and Mediator, over all the reſt of the Biſhops and Paſtors of the particular churches within Epheſus, Smyrna, &amp;c. As if this had been written to the Angel of the church of England, that is, ſaith the Epiſcopals to the Archbiſhop, who is the chief Prelate and Biſhop over all other the Prelates and Biſhops in England: Or if it had been directed to the Angel of the church of London, Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Exeter, &amp;c. that is, ſay they, to the Biſhop of London, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury, or Exeter, &amp;c. who is the chief Biſhop, Paſtor, and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53073:58"/>
over all the reſt of the Biſhops and Paſtors within his own Juriſdiction and Dioceſs.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer firſt, that the words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we tranſlate according to the Latine Dialect Biſhops and Paſtors, or according to our own proper Idiome, Overſeers, and Feeders of the Flock are Synonimas, and are but as ſeveral denominations of one and the ſame Office, which do ariſe from divers acts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For the faculty of over-ſeeing, guidance, and direction, he is called a Biſhop; for that of teaching, inſtructing, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally feeding his flock in all kinds, he is called a Paſtor, and very often too in Scripture for his rootedneſs and ſoundneſs in faith, life, and doctrine, he is called an Elder; ſo that theſe are but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names of one and the ſame office, and often applyed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture reciprocally to one and the ſame perſon; ſomtimes he is called the Elder of the church, ſomtimes the Biſhop, ſomtimes the Paſtor; to denote unto us, that ſuch as guide well their flocks, and feed them with the green paſtures of wholſome doctrines, are moſt worthy of double honour amongſt the Saints; but leſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſhould be elevated above their proper ſtation, they ought to eye another Title too, which is given them in Scripture, they are Miniſters, that is, Servants that attend on Chriſt and his churches; they receive Chriſt's meſſages, and commend them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his churches, and come again with returns of the churches im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in obedience and thankfulneſs unto Chriſt; and for this reaſon they are here entitled by the name of Angels, Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Ambaſſadors, or Miniſters of Chriſt; and how theſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Titles of Servitors and Meſſengers will ſuit and agree to the Lording ſtomacks of Metropolitans, and Lord Biſhops, or chief Paſtors over many churches, it paſſes my skill to conjecture. There was a time when the good Biſhop of Rome did take on him that ſelf-denying Title only of <hi>Servus ſervorum Chriſti,</hi> A ſervant to the ſervants of Chriſt; but O now, <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As ſome of the Presbyterian intereſt will have this Inſcription, <hi>To the Angel of the Church of Epheſus,</hi> to be meant the Presbytery, or the combined Elders of the church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which is aſſerted with far leſs reaſon then the former; for it is inſcribed, Unto the Angel, not Angels of the church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: neither is it clear that there were more political churches then one in Epheſus, to make up a combination of divers, as the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery will have it; but rather the contrary is evident, for if there were more churches then one in Epheſus, the Inſcription would run more rationally thus, Unto the Angels of the churches of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But here they will object (as I have found that one of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned champions, I mean M. <hi>Rutherford</hi> formerly hath done) That Angel here is to be taken collectively, as that, <hi>The Angel of the Lord ſhall pitch his Tents about the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I grant, Angel in that Scripture ought to be taken collectively,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53073:58"/>
for many Angels; but that it ſhould ſo in this place, is a meer <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> yea rather, a foul abſurdity will be according to this ſenſe of theirs, father'd on the Spirit of God in this place: for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the Presbyterie, which is a collective and combined body of many Elders of divers churches, which they would have here to be meant by the Angel: All of the Presbyterian judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do intend thereby the church repreſentative; as <hi>Go tell the Church,</hi> that is, ſay they, the Presbyterie. <hi>Hear the Church,</hi> that is, ſay they, the Presbyterie. Now that this word Angel will ſtand with ſuch interpretation, ſounds very harſhly; for obſerve what a ſtrange and uncouth ſound and ſenſe do theſe words give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>To the Angel of the church of Epheſus,</hi> that is, to the church of the church of Epheſus, according to their acceptation; for ſo they call the Presbyterie, the church: I ſuppoſe few will find but very little reaſon in ſuch a ſenſe; yet I grant that in one church there may be many Miniſters, ſo there might be in Epheſus many Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, many Elders, many Deacons, for they are all Miniſters unto the church of Chriſt; ſo alſo they might have one that had the preheminence over the reſt, as the Overſeer, Biſhop, or Paſtor of the flock, whoſe care and office is not only to rule and guide the flock, but to feed them alſo, and ſuch a one is worthy of double honour, in reſpect of the eminency of his miniſterial ſervice above the reſt, and ſo might rightly be called the Angel catexochen, or chief Meſſenger or Miniſter of the church of Epheſus, to whom theſe admonitions were directed; and ſo I take the word Angel in this place to ſignifie the chief Miniſter, to wit, the Biſhop or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor which God had ſet over the church of Epheſus, to whom the charge is inſcribed, and this was <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> juſtifies, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. out of <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epiſtle unto the church of Epheſus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> From this former diſcourſe note, That the Paſtors and chief Miniſters of churches, are the fitteſt inſtruments to receive and deliver Chriſts meſſages and intendments unto his churches. They can do it authoritatively, <hi>ex Officio,</hi> by vertue of their call unto that end: Others of private capacity can do it only charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>virtute doni,</hi> by vertue of a gift, by way of advice and counſel: The charge here is inſcribed to the Angel or Paſtor of the church of Epheſus, and it is the rather inſcribed and directed to the chief Miniſter, for ſundry reaſons: Firſt, That it might have the greater reverence and authority with them to whom it was directed. Secondly, That it might be ſet home on their hearts with the greater wiſdom and vigour; for admonitions or reproofs coming from Paſtors, or the chief Miniſters of the church, are as nails driven by the maſters of Aſſemblies. Thirdly, That it might be done with the more faithfulneſs, for they are the Overſeers of Chriſt's flock. Fourthly, That it might be done with the more tenderneſs and compaſſion, for they are the Shepherds or Paſtors of Chriſt's flock, to feed and heal them, notto wound or deſtroy
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53073:59"/>
them. Fifthly and laſtly, That it might be done with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt experience, for they are the Elders of the church, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all our ſpiritual maladies, and know their ſeveral cures, and are the beſt Phyſitians (next and ſubordinate to Chriſt) for our ſouls in the world. O let us therefore give them due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reverence, which is moſt commendable and worthy of a ſound chriſtian, to all Chriſt's true and faithful Miniſters and Ambaſſadors of his Word and Goſpel, whom Chriſt hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the names of Angels, Biſhops, Paſtors, Elders, and the like; let us not diſhonour, vilifie, or upbraid, with any brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or unworthy Titles whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. <hi>Unto the Angel of the Church of Epheſus, Write,</hi>] Hence Note, That every rightly conſtituted and well ordered church, ought to have their Angel, Miniſter, or Paſtor over them. Every golden candleſtick ought to have their burning Lamps within them, to give light to all that come before them; ſee more hereon on the laſt verſe of the firſt chapter. Yet in this I deſire to be underſtood, not as if the Being and form of a church did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main wholly in the Officers thereof, but in the whole Fraternity of Believers, the eſſential matter thereof primarily and chiefly; ſo that I here intend the well-being of a church, not the being thereof: and ſo I affirm, that two, or three, or more gathered together in the name of Chriſt, to cloſe with him in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though without Miniſterial Officers, yet may be for the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial matter termed a faithful church of Chriſt, but not a political organical one, which hath the higheſt and greateſt glory on it: for I am of opinion, that the firſt hath the priviledge of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe only of ſome Ordinances within themſelves, as Prayer, &amp;c. but the latter hath the more full and ample Goſpel pattent and commiſſion, even to the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, and unto excommunication and higheſt cenſures, which cannot rightly be executed out of political churches, which are meerly acts of power, office, and authority.</p>
                  <p>From the words, the church of Epheſus, of Smyrna, of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus, &amp;c. Some hence abſurdly reaſon for a National church: 'Tis true, there was a church at Epheſus, at Smyrna, at Corinth, at Rome; but to argue from hence that all in Rome, all in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, all in Epheſus muſt be the church, is a very fond reaſoning: This were to argue, that <hi>Nero</hi> that bloody heatheniſh Tyrant, with his whole houſhould, not much unlike unto himſelf in barbarous cruelty, were the church of Chriſt, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the church in <hi>Nero's</hi> houſe; and though there was the church of Chriſt in Epheſus, yet I preſume, on good grounds, that moſt or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Epheſus cryed up, <hi>Great was Diana of the Epheſians,</hi> and though there were churches of Chriſt in Rome, Corinth, Smyrna, Pergamus, and other places mentioned in Scripture, yet we know by good hiſtory, that the National Worſhip and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was Ethnick, unto <hi>Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus,</hi> &amp;c. yet indeed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53073:59"/>
I confeſs, a Church may be called the National church, as that of Epheſus, of England, of France, of Scotland, &amp;c. in reſpect of the church conſtituted and made up of members or perſons of that Nation; but herein we have no difference, the controverſie is not about words, but things really differing among themſelves; as when they affirm every individual and ſingular parochial church of England, to be particular churches of Chriſt, as parts of the whole, and the whole to be the National church of England, conſtituted of its ſingular parts. If all England, Scotland, France, be the church, what room is left for the world, and the profane therein? The church may be denominated of England, Scotland, France, &amp;c. but not all England, Scotland, France to be the church, there is great difference in thoſe expreſſions, but of this I ſhall ſay no farther at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Having done with the Inſcription or direction, <hi>To the Angel of the Church of Epheſus,</hi> the next thing is, <hi>write,</hi> for the better obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the things that follow. <hi>Theſe things, ſaith he, that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſeven Stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the ſeven golden Candlesticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the church of Epheſus, and the reſt, may know from whom this ſubſequent meſſage comes, tell them, that it is from him that holdeth and keepeth in his fatherly hand of protection, his faithful Miniſters and Paſtors, which are as ſtars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his churches, for glory. Peruſe the ſixteenth verſe of the firſt chapter more fully to this purpoſe. <hi>And who walketh,</hi> that is, is in active poſture, ready to obſerve all the doings, whether good or evil, of all his churches; and therefore he is ſaid to walk in the midſt of his ſeven golden candleſticks: conſult more at large with v. 13. &amp; 20. of c. 1. From Chriſt's poſture of walking in the midſt of the ſeven golden candleſticks, or the ſeven Aſian churches, note.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt is very intent, with an eye of providential obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that for their good, over all his faithful churches.</p>
                  <p>This is not the time of his ſitting on the Throne, of judging the world, but of walking in the midſt of his golden candleſticks; viewing the order of his churches, and to ſee whether they are proficients under the means of grace, according to that of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> cap 6. 11. <hi>I went down into the garden of Nuts, to ſee the fruits of the Valley, and to ſee whether the Vine flouriſhed, and the Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tes budded.</hi> Chriſt is now viewing his churches graces, taking delight therein, and to encourage them to perſeverance, that the crown may be unto them that overcome; and alſo takes a ſpecial notice of their backſlidings, and lays them before their eyes, in the deceitfulneſs thereof, that they may loath them, and return unto their God by a holy repentance. And this is but a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his promiſe at his departure, left as his laſt comforting Legacy with his afflicted church. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. That though he was aſcended into the higheſt heavens, yet in his providential eye over them, and by his Spirit, teaching, directing, counſelling,

ſupporting, and comforting them, he would be ever with them, unto the end of the world.</p>

Chriſt ſees and knows the works of the church of Epheſus fully, what are approvable, and what are diſapprovable in them. Hence Note.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt is a moſt juſt and equal cenſurer of his churches works. He forbids to call darkneſs light, or light darkneſs; he tells the church of Epheſus, that he knows their works of travel, patience and ſufferance for his Name ſake, and ſo places his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable aſpect and complacency thereon; and yet what is evil in them, he cannot bear without a reproof, as 'tis defection or failure in its firſt love, and ardent affections, which the church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus bore to Chriſt, and his Truths, at their firſt converſion or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the Goſpel amongſt them, verſ. 4. Chriſt alſo tels the church of Sardis and Laodicea, that he knows their works,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53073:60"/>
but in another tone, not of approbation, but of reproof and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; he ſaid to Sardis, cap. 3. 1. <hi>I know thy works, for thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, but thou art dead;</hi> and in verſe 15. he falls upon Laodicea, and tells them, <hi>I know thy works, that thou art nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold nor hot, I would thou wert cold or hot:</hi> Chriſt will not pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate, or lay cuſhions under great ones elbows, and propheſie ſmooth things unto them, nor to the churches that bears them, whilſt they are moſt rotten in the root and heart. Had not God a controverſie of old with his Iſrael for this very ſin, abundantly witneſſed againſt by God in moſt of the old Prophets; When as ſome would ſtand up and propheſie peace, when there was no peace? as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.10.16. <hi>And what have they to do with peace, while their hands are full of blood and iniquity??</hi> I could wiſh it were not the ſin of ſome of the pretended Angels of the churches in thoſe days, where is that faithful one to be found? It may be one of a thouſand, that as a true Angel or Ambaſſador from Chriſt, will deal roundly with their ſins, and tell Iſrael of her ſins, and Judah of her tranſgreſſions. Good Phyſitians will ſearch the wounds thorowly, the rather for to cure them: It is alſo Chriſt's method, to lay open the wounds and ſins of his churches, that ſo he may (like the good Samaritane) pour oyl into them, and heal them, and bring to repentance: Chriſts Miniſters ſhould follow their maſter's pattern, deal faithfully, ſimply, and roundly with the ſins of their people, according to Goſpel rule in that caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and not as many do, ſpeak peace, and words of comfort, (the true portion of ſpiritual members of Chriſt) unto profeſſed enemies to Godlineſs, and the Saints, ſcorners and deriders of Chriſt's ways and ordinances, drunkards, ſwearers, &amp;c. what have ſuch to do with the childrens bread, ſo continuing unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and obſtinate? It is much to be feared, for this lukewarmneſs of many Miniſters and churches, it will come to paſs, that Chriſt wil ſpew them out of his mouth, cap. 3. 16. as he did the church of Laodicea, and the church of Iſrael of old, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. I ſhall only add that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22, 23. to be ſeriouſly conſidered in the cloſe of this point: The Prophet ſpeaking to thoſe that ſowed pillows under the Arms-holes, becauſe with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad, and ſtrengthned the hands of the wicked, that he ſhould not turn from his wicked way, by promiſing him life: Therefore ye ſhall ſee no more vanity, nor divine divinations, for I will deliver my people out of your hand, and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. Another correllary hence riſeth, That all churches and perſons ought to have and receive a due acknowledgement of all graces and vertues that they are eminent in, though chargeable with many defections and failings otherwiſe. Chriſt ſpares not to acknowledge, but makes honourable mention of the graces of the churches, in this and the next chapter, though otherwiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aberrations and failings were laid unto their charge. Though
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53073:61"/>
the church of Epheſus was to be reproved for the coldneſs in her firſt love, yet ſhe had theſe commendable vertues and graces in her, conſtancy and patience under ſufferings for Chriſt's ſake, and hatred to all evil workers, and falſe lights, and Apoſtles, that come with doctrines deſtructive to the great fundamental, or corner ſtone, the true doctrine of faith in Chriſt: and ſo Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds with the other churches in the like method, and lays a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable character on them all for thoſe graces in them worthily calling for it. <hi>Paul</hi> could give a juſt acknowledgement to his brethren the Jews, though otherwiſe perverſe enough, bearing them witneſs, that <hi>they had a zeal to God, though not according to knowledge,</hi> Rom. 10.2. And Chriſt told the Jews, and ſpoke it with approbation, and to their commendation, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe ye alſo in me.</hi> It is the great fault of moſt of profeſſors of theſe days, of all ſort of perſwaſions, that they will not almoſt acknowledge him a brother in Chriſt, or give him the right hand of fellowſhip, that is not baptized into the ſame opinions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with himſelf; but this rather ſavours of a ſpirit ſchiſmatical and factious, then of a meek chriſtianlike peace-making temper, which will bear all things that are indifferent, rather then break the communion and unity of brethren, who have put on one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme. O! what a lamentable practiſe it is, for ſuch as are Presbyterians, to rake up all the faults, and dirt they can, and caſt it in the faces of Independents? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for Independents to caſt it back on the Presbyterians; and both of them to caſt it in the faces of thoſe called Anabaptiſts, and they again as ready as the former, to repay it back again: Why? Have you ſo learned Chriſt? O! for ſhame, let all that fear God of each ſort, be aſhamed of this unchriſtianlike practiſe, let it not be told in Gath, nor publiſhed in Askelon; but follow the ſteps of your common Saviour, what you ſee of God in your brethren, commend it, encourage it, cheriſh it: Though there may be failings in each ſort, and that great ones, yet for that grace and appearance of God in them, love them, honour them, and think better of them then of thy ſelf, though thou mayſt be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſome externals of Worſhip then they, yet they may be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then thee in doctrinals; and though thou art ſounder then they in doctrinals, yet they may be the more holy, and better men: I ſpeak not this to comply with any corrupt doctrine or worſhip, but to give every one his due titles of honour, love, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for their gifts and graces; and for their faults and failings, deal with them in a ſpirit of love and charity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. for their recovery and repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to Goſpel order; for ſo thou mayeſt win thy brother: but by the other way, thou art ſure to drive him farther from thee. It is obſervable, that the Familiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notioniſts, the Quakers in theſe days, are highly baptized in this ſin, and out run all others in this uncharitable and unchriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like practiſe; they are ſharp cenſurers of all others, churches, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53073:61"/>
perſons, that will not run in the ſame fanatique wilde courſes with themſelves; and which is ſtrange, and moſt obſervable, is, that they never will acknowledge, nor give a due commendation to any, though never ſo ſelf-denying, and godly, and filled abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly with all the graces of the Spirit, unleſs they take up the ſame mad opinions with themſelves; and therefore not ſtrange, when they have loſt the ſpirit of love and charity, and in ſtead thereof, are filled with a ſpirit of ſelf-fulneſs and pride, that they tread under foot the blood of the covenant, as an unholy thing, and ſo carried on to damnable and blaſphemous opinions and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. Amongſt the many reaſons that we ought to give a due acknowledgement to the graces in the godly, theſe are ſome.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God may have the due honour, as the author of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe all graces are of the ſame Spirits working, and therefore worthy of honour whereſoever they are found.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the encouragement and cheriſhing all perſons under all hardſhips and afflictions, in acquiring and maintaining thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alive, fructifying and effective.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, That their ſins may not ſo diſcourage the godly, as to think nothing praiſe worthy in them, whiles they have many things in them worthy to be praiſed, cheriſhed, and followed, as having the impreſs of the Spirit on them.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt having given his approbation of the ſufferings, conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and patience of the church of Epheſus for his names ſake, and taking notice thereof as their works catexochen, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> that is, I take notice of theſe your graces, and works of ſuffering, patience, and zeal againſt ſuch workers, falſe Teachers, and falſe Apoſtles, and theſe are your good works, worthy of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and imitation in you: Now in all our actions obſerve, there muſt be many circumſtantial ingredients to denominate them by the name of good works: according to that old rule,
<q>A Quo, cui, quomodo, quando.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, They muſt proceed from a true Fountain: God's Spirit muſt be the firſt Mover and Author of them; corrupt Nature can produce nothing higher then it ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9, 10. God can look upon none of our duties or works with an eye of complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, unleſs they have in the firſt place his ſtamp upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Cui.</hi> You muſt examine to what ends, and to whom, to whoſe name and glory they are directed; if we ſacrifice to our ſelves, for our own ends and advantages, our ſacrifice is in vain, an abomination, and as the cutting off a dogs head, in as much as we do it unto our ſelves, and not unto the Lord: conſider <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. A good action or work may loſe its crown for want of a right end. If we pray, repent, mourn for ſin, &amp;c. which are neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet if we only reſpect our ſelves, and our own ends, to wit, to be freed and delivered only from wrath to come, not having an
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53073:62"/>
eye to the ſanctifying of God's name thereby, we may loſe much of the comfort of thoſe duties, if not the duties themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſin unto us; for all muſt be done unto the glory of his Name.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You muſt conſider the <hi>Quomodo:</hi> In what manner works are to be done, to denominate them good; they muſt not be done Phariſaically, to be ſeen of men; ſo they loſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſufferings and patience of the church of Epheſus for the name of Chriſt, were highly commendable graces in them, yet if they ſhould affect them as the popelings do, to attain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the glory and name of Martyrs, they had their rewards: The Familiſtical Quakers of theſe days, do moſt perverſly walk in the ſame ſteps, highly affecting ſufferings, and ruſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, not conſidering the <hi>Cui,</hi> nor the <hi>Quomodo,</hi> neither to what end they do it, nor the manner how they do it: Indeed perſons may ſuffer juſtly for their pertinacy and obſtinacy againſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but not for the name of Chriſt, unleſs in his providence he calls them to it. Therefore</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Quando</hi> is alſo to be conſidered, the time when they are to be performed. To beſtow a beneficence on a rich per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or one that wants it not, it cannot be called an act of charity, for they are able to make retribution for it; but to do it towards Chriſt's poor afflicted members, when their wants and neceſſities call for it, then it is truly a good work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, To draw ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings on ones ſelf for ones pertinaciouſneſs in opinions not rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as neceſſaries, or fundamentals unto ſalvation, and ſo diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of Commonwealths in the promotion thereof, this cannot be termed a ſuffering for Chriſt's name: But it muſt be clear and real Truths that juſtifies a ſoul in his ſufferings for it, that the ſoul and conſcience be kept undefiled thereby, and ſo become a faithful witneſs unto Chriſt, and the Truth, when God calls him to it in clear diſpenſations of providence. See more hereon in v. 9. of the former chapter.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, in the laſt place underſtand, That the beſt and choiceſt of our works, though they are all rightly circumſtantiated, as aforeſaid, yet ſtrictly and ſimply in themſelves, according to the rules of Juſtice, they are not to be called good works; for ſo, and in that ſenſe, God is only good, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.18. and our beſt works being mingled with much weakneſs and imperfection in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of them, though the agency of God's Spirit is manifeſtly in them, yet paſſing through corrupt conduits, and the hands of ſinful inſtruments, they receive a tincture of the veſſels and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement from the ſinful Agents that do produce and effect them, and ſo ſingly in themſelves are ſinful and imperfect: But as our perſons are accepted in Chriſt, our works, though otherwiſe weak, ſinful, and imperfect in themſelves, being performed in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our ſouls, God accepteth, as good, holy, and perfect, as being done and preſented in the name of Chriſt, and upon that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53073:62"/>
altar, that both ſanctifies the gift and the giver: In vain to ſeek for an acceptation of our works before our perſons be in Chriſt, then he accepts the will for the deed, and our works, though weak and imperfect in themſelves, yet in Chriſt, and as flowing from his divine efficiency, they are accepted of God, as moſt holy, good, and perfect.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall in the next place conſider more eſpecially, what was commendable in the church of Epheſus, which was the labour and patience they under-went for Chriſt's ſake; which did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear in their zeal againſt evil doers, and falſe Apoſtles, which they could not bear. From hence Note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That it is equally burdenſome, troubleſome, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to Chriſt's faithful churches, to have evil doers, and falſe teachers amongſt them. The one doth corrupt their manners, the other their judgements; the one is pernicious in their examples, the other in their doctrines; the one deſtroyeth the life of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the other the truth of God; and where the one is tolerated, the other follows alſo: for if evil workers are forborn in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, their judgements will be ſoon corrupted, to endeavour to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their more corrupt practiſes: for ſuch as keep not to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, he gives them over judicially to embrace and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low falſe Teachers, and to believe lies and vanities. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, When falſe Teachers are tolerated, quickly follows evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes: When in the time of the late Biſhops, in oppoſition to the godly, it was aſſerted, that the Law that required the obſervation of the Sabbath, was not moral, but only humane and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique; what followed that falſe teaching, but moſt profane and wicked practiſe of carding, bowling, ſporting, revelling, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and all ſort of profaneſs upon that day? Uprightneſs in life and doctrine, are the two pillars of a church, and where one fails the other will ſoon fall to ground after: they are as inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble twins, the corruption of the one will be the death of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is to be obſerved, as ſoon as theſe primitive churches en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained falſe Apoſtles amongſt them, we preſently hear of the obſcene Sect of the Nicholaitans following; the divel will not be contented to corrupt the head only, but the heart alſo, and if in the firſt place he corrupts the heart, the evil affections will ſoon fume into the judgement, and darken the underſtanding; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a uſe of caution hence ariſeth to Chriſt's churches; That if they be zealous of God's glory, and their own well-being, that they ſuffer not peaceably amongſt them, either evil doers, or falſe Teachers, both equally tending, if tolerated, to their deſtruction and ruine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. It is often a matter of great trouble and travel for the churches of Chriſt, to deal with evil doers, and falſe teachers in the church. When the corrupted part is become a great Intereſt in the church, how difficult is it for the ſound part to meddle with it: Witneſs the preſent ſtate of our churches in England, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53073:63"/>
amongſt the Nations, deſiring Reformation from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian errors and idolatry; what a matter of trouble it is, and ſomtimes of much affliction and ſufferings to divers precious and ſound chriſtians, when they go about to reprove the falſe teachers, and evil workers, the great hinderers at preſent of a thorow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the Ordinances and Doctrines of Chriſt? How they fall upon ſuch as the troublers of Iſrael? Not conſidering that their luſts are the principal cauſes thereof; and if Chriſt's witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſpeak againſt them in faithfulneſs, they are preſently branded as troublers of their peace and factions, and often ſuffer for it: The church of Epheſus had their portion herein, of travel and patience, for their integrity unto Chriſt and his Truth, againſt theſe teachers and wicked perſons in that primitive age, ſo neer Chriſt's time, and the pouring forth of the Spirit; and therefore no marvel if under the falling away, and Antichriſt's dominion, Chriſt's faithful witneſſes have a ſhare therein alſo.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, <hi>And thou haſt tryed them which ſay they are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and are not, and haſt found them lyars.</hi>] It ſeems Epheſus had pſeudo-Apoſtles, or falſe Apoſtles, as well as Corinth, and other churches, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. who pretended themſelves to be true Apoſtles of Chriſt; who under that pretence, came with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and ſoul-deſtroying doctrines; as, That the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was paſt already, That the Moſaical Law was to be joyned to faith in Chriſt for juſtification; That the community of all things and women were lawful, which they called ſpiritual marriages, which the ſect of Nicolaitans held: Theſe were the errours of the falſe Apoſtles of the primitive days. Now the Apoſtles of Chriſt were extraordinary Officers ſent by him; ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
ſignifies, one ſent to his ſervice for the publiſhing the Meſſias and his doctrine over the whole world, and ſo were univerſal Officers, and could act in and over all churches by their Apoſtolical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but for others to argue from their practiſe, that are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers, and of an ordinary ſpirit, that they may act as they did, is a meer <hi>non ſequitur:</hi> Now the falſe Apoſtles would it ſeems needs arrogate the ſame authority to themſelves, in impoſing their dictates upon the churches; but the church of Epheſus had ſo much ſpiritual wiſdom as to try and examine them, and ſo found them falſe ones, and liars.</p>
                  <p>Hence note, That it is a moſt commendable practiſe and duty in Chriſt's churches, to make a diligent and narrow inquiſition into the truth of all doctrines and teachers that come among them. The church of Epheſus was very famous for this very thing, and an <hi>Euge</hi> given them by Chriſt for this action: And indeed, how could they, or any other churches, find out the deceitfulneſs and falſity of thoſe that were falſe Apoſtles, and falſe Teachers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had tryed and examined their doctrines? <hi>Paul</hi> accounted the Bereans more noble then others, for this very thing, for the enquiry into the truth of his doctrine, whether things were ſo or
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53073:63"/>
no as he delivered unto them: for indeed it argues a moſt ſtupid kind of diſpoſition, to receive all things that comes from men without enquiry, either into the truth thereof, or at leaſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, faithfulneſs, and the authority of the Relator thereof: for as ſome truths lie deep, and every common perſon or member can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fathom it, yet every one, though never ſo weak, that cannot ſatisfie their conſciences by their own ſight in the entertainment of a truth, yet can in part acquieſce in the ability and fidelity of their Teacher, and ſo may get much ſatisfaction unto themſelves from the authority of their guides and teachers; therefore it is a duty incumbent on all Firſt, for the more ſpiritual and quick-ſighted chriſtian, to try all things, and to hold faſt what is good. Next, for the weaker chriſtian, to try the faithfulneſs and integrity of his Teachers, and to hold faſt what he commends unto him in things diſputable, and not of eaſie diſcernment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Query.</hi> But a Queſtion may be moved, who ſhall try, judge, and examine falſe Apoſtles, falſe Teachers, and their corrupt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, every private or particular chriſtian may do it, <hi>Judicio diſcretionis,</hi> by a judgement of diſcretion, and of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diſcerning.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, to try them <hi>Judicio Authoritativo,</hi> by a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of authority, and juridically, it muſt be done by that whole church wherein they are riſen up and maintained; for in them lies the plenary judicial power and authority of judging all doctrines and teachers, which is uſually called the power of the Keys. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this power in the Officers or Elderſhip of the church, when diſtinct from the Body, as ſome would have it, but collectively, in the whole church Officers and Members, though unto the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, or Officers, I ſhould grant the precedency in many things, yet the Body collective is above the Officers; for the Officers are ordained more principally for the Body, but not the Body for the Officers: but the head cannot ſay unto the body, I have no need of thee; nor the body unto the head, but all joynt together makes up a compleat harmony, and an organical Body; Officers and Members in a church, make up a compleat chriſtian, or micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm, or commonwealth, wherein all the Laws of Chriſt are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridically adminiſtred, and who have the full power of trying, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, and judging all falſe Teachers and doctrines that ſhall riſe amongſt them: For if the juridical power were ſolely in the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, or Officers of the church, then the church of Epheſus would not collectively deſerve that Eulogie and approbation for their zeal againſt falſe Apoſtles, but it would rather be attributed to the Angel of the church, or chief Officers or Overſeers of the church only; but here the whole church of Epheſus is praiſed and approved for their non-toleration of evil perſons, and for their trying of, and ſifting out the falſe Apoſtles; therefore it argueth very ſtrongly, that the power of cenſures and trying, is not ſingly

in the Officers, but in Officers and members joyntly, as making up one organical Body politique, which is Chriſt's higheſt Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature on earth, to decide and judge of all Doctrines riſing in his churches, that will not hold weight according to the ſhekel of the Sanctuary. A farther inſtance ye have pregnant to this purpoſe in the church of Thyatira, in verſe 20. following; where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is laid home cloſe on the whole church of Thyatira, for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the woman Jezabel, and her prophetique deluſions: Now if it were alone in the Angels power of Thyatira to deal with theſe Balaamitiſh prophets, the Spirit of Chriſt would eſpecially lay the burden and reproof upon them, to wit, the Superintendents of the church; but it is clearly notified unto us, that the charge is wholly laid home upon the churches, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Let him that hath an ear, hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches:</hi> Though I grant, the Elderſhip or Officers may be the mouth of Chriſt unto the churches, and again the churches mouth unto Chriſt, and ſo they are his Ambaſſadors agitating in his name, and are to precede in many duties in relation to the church, yet the charge for admiſſion and entertainment of heterodoxies, and corruptions in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, is not ſolely laid upon them, but upon the whole churches: ſo hence this is clearly evinced, that thoſe that are juſtly charged for the admiſſion and permiſſion of evil, had an indubitable power and authority in themſelves, either not to admit it, or being admitted, to try it, and cut it off by ſuch means as are appointed for ſuch ends: but the whole church of Thyatira is juſtly charged for the admiſſion and permiſſion of corruptions among them, therefore the concluſion is evident. But this ſhall ſuffice herein. See more hereon, v. 20. following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But is not this (with the Papiſts) to raiſe the juriſdiction of the church ſo high, as to ſet it above the ſoveraignty of the Word?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer negatively: for a Soveraign Prince receives no dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of honour for his ſubordinate Miniſters of State to receive that honour due unto their place; neither ſo doth the Word loſe at all of its glory, for that the church hath its due honour put upon it alſo: indeed the Word is <hi>ſuprema Lex,</hi> the Standard, the Rule and light by which all doctrines are tryed and diſcerned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Divine Revelation, and in its ſelf infallible, muſt needs be above the authority, and of a ſurer teſtimony then that which is mixed with much fallibility and imperfection, as the choiceſt and pureſt churches ever were, as thoſe of Corinth, Epheſus, Galatia, &amp;c. And as a Law of meer humane inſtitution is reputed of ſo high authority, that it binds the Legiſlators themſelves, and in that reſpect is above thoſe that made it; but much more the Word of God, which is his Law, and his revealed mind, coming from ſo infinite and unerrable a Legiſlator as God is, ſo far tranſcends the authority of any Judicature on earth, as the wiſdom of an infinite does a finite creature, therefore muſt needs be binding to all to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53073:64"/>
whom it is made known, having ſuch a perfection in it, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is converſant therein, it is able, by the bleſſing of the Spirit, to make him wiſe unto ſalvation, and perfect in every good thing and work. The Word unto the Church, is as the Sun unto the Dial; if the Dial be ſet right to the Sun, it will give a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the time of the day; ſo if the church gives a judgement according to the ſquare and ſcantling of the Word, it will be a righteous judgement; but otherwiſe, to make the Word ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient, and to conclude unto the churches dictates is an undertaking to rectifie the courſe of the Sun unto the obliquity of the Dial, which will prove <hi>Aethiopiam lvvare,</hi> and moſt irrational. So that church that keeps her ſelf within her own ſphere, and tries and examines ſpirits and doctrines that are heterodox and unſound, by the ſound of the Word, which is a moſt ſure light, and infallible cynoſure, doubtleſs that church will be led and preſerved in all truth: But if any one ſo far exalts its ſelf, as to conclude for truth its own dictates, diſſentaneous unto the Word, but ſuiting with ſelf-intereſt and deſigne; the firſt may be a golden candleſtick, both precious and famous for its faith, integrity, and juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man; but the latter will ſoon degenerate into an harlot-church, if not ſoon become apoſtate to the faith. The firſt is Chriſt's higheſt Judicature on earth, wherein he takes delight to walk in, as his Garden encloſed, to view their pleaſant fruits, but the other Chriſt will look upon as a rotten Tree, that cumbers the ground, and ſerves only to be hewen down, and caſt into the fire.</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. Another Obſervation is, That in the pureſt times and churches, there are found great corruptions, both in manners and doctrines. In this famous church of Epheſus, Corinth, &amp;c. in the Apoſtles days, were found both <gap reason="foreign">

and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, evil ones, and falſe ones; ſuch as pretended they were Apoſtles, but were found liars and deceivers. Amongſt the twelve there was a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das. In that church in the Ark, when the world and church had one and the ſame extent and boundaries, in eight perſons only, yet one was a <hi>Cham;</hi> and there was alſo a <hi>Cain</hi> when it was of a leſſer number, and but four in the world.</p>
                  <p>But here <hi>obiter,</hi> and by the way, we muſt be careful to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between God's Decretive will, and his Preceptive Will. His <hi>Voluntas bene placiti,</hi> and <hi>Voluntas ſigni,</hi> as the Schools call it. or his will of purpoſe, and his will of good pleaſure: Not that there are two Wills in God, but ſeveral and divers acts of one and the ſame Will; as by the ſame will we love, by the ſame will we hate; by the ſame will we purpoſe one thing, by the ſame will we command another thing; yet they are not two contradictory wills, but divers acts of one and the ſame will. <hi>Diverſa non ſunt contraria.</hi> Now though God may in his providential wiſdom ordain falſe teachers, and wicked perſons to be found in his church for divers ends known unto God, and more eſpecially for the tryal
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53073:65"/>
of the faithful, and the exaltation of his grace, yet they are much miſtaken that hence argue either for admiſſion of wicked perſons, or unſound in the faith, into the fellowſhip of the church, or for their toleration therein after a diſcovery; for it is the command of God to the contrary, That we admit not ſuch, being known, into the conſortſhip of the church; or being admitted, upon diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we tolerate them not: for if they were to be admitted and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated quietly within the church, then doubtleſs the church of Epheſus had not received that encomium, and <hi>well done</hi> for their zeal againſt them: nor the church of Thyatira that worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for the ſuffering that woman Jezabel amongſt them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one church did her duty, and obeyed Chriſt's preceptive will, and had the praiſe and glory for it; the other neglected it, and therefore had a juſt check laid upon her: So that this queſtion is to be ſtated <hi>de Jure, non de Facto:</hi> I confeſs, <hi>de facto,</hi> there may be evil perſons, falſe teachers in the beſt churches, and pureſt times, but <hi>de jure,</hi> it ought not to be ſo; for that which ſeems and tends to the deſtruction of a church, ſhould in no wiſe be admitted; but the admiſſion and toleration of ſuch wicked perſons, tends to that end. The illation is very clear from the nature of wickedneſs, which is of a deſtroying nature to all entertainers of it; witneſs thoſe ſeven famous Aſian churches, and many other Eaſtern churches, who for their iniquities and tranſgreſſions from the rule and faith of Chriſt, are in ſtead of pleaſant Gardens, wherein the Lord delighted in, ſpewed out, and become the habitation of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and receptacles of all unclean ſpirits. Therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound to argue from acts of God's providence, to his will: The act of <hi>Judas</hi> in betraying Chriſt, was never the leſs abominated in the ſight of God, becauſe he had pre-ordained it in his eternal decrees: We muſt be ſure to do no evil (againſt all which God hath declared his diſpleaſure from heaven) on pretence that the Divine wiſdom can order it to good, and draw praiſe unto it ſelf out of the wrath of man. It is a ſure maxime and rule unto us, to act by the rule of God's commands which are patent, not of his providential actings and decrees, whoſe meaning unto us are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed, and ſecret.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome here comes with a replication, and object, and ſay, That they grant, that manifeſt, ſcandalous, and wicked perſons, and erroneous, are not to be admitted and tolerated in the church; but withal add, and anſwer by another queſtion, that it cannot be defended or made good, that none ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or tolerated in the church, but ſuch as are true and real Saints; for ſo they ſay, we make the church of God of no larger extent then the Elect themſelves. I have met ſomwhat to the ſame purpoſe, in the writings of a Learned Gentleman, Mr <hi>W. Morice</hi> of Devon, in his <hi>New Incloſures broken down,</hi> page 110. who ſays, That he undertakes not to be an Advocate for perſons notoriouſly wicked and ſcandalous, not aſſerting that thoſe which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53073:65"/>
are notorious for ſins, may not be rejected, but that without tryed and approved notes of ſanctity, they may be admitted: nor that men, whoſe flagitiouſneſs is publiquely known, may be repelled, but none upon any private notion of their faults may be excluded: and thus much will be inevitably concluded from the example of <hi>Judas</hi> his admiſſion, which was the <hi>Diana</hi> contended for, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to uſe his own words, <hi>Hos quaeſitum munus in uſus.</hi> And in page 61. he aſſerts, We do only here argue, that Sacraments, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally as ſuch, are not proper priviledges of real Saints, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incommunicable to any but ſuch as have given ſatisfaction of their holineſs, which is their hypotheſis, againſt which we are diſputing. Thus far he.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer, I could refer M. <hi>Morice</hi> to another learned man of theſe times, if he would account it as good payment to be referred to another, and an able paymaſter without exception, even learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> the great anti-Separatiſt, and anti-Anabaptiſt of theſe days, who hath ſufficiently, and with Achillean arguments made good that Theſis againſt M. <hi>Blakes</hi> dogmatical faith, That it is a true juſtifying faith that entitles to Baptiſme, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially, to other Ordinances of the church: And alſo againſt M. <hi>Bedford,</hi> his Baptiſmal Regeneration, who hath ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in that diſpute againſt him, That Baptiſme doth not convey the firſt grace, but that the firſt grace was neceſſarily pre-required before Baptiſme: And though hereby M. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly armed his adverſaries the anti-Paidobaptiſts, who takes up, as the Lancaſtrians did of old to the Yorkiſts in the Battel of <hi>Towton,</hi> the ſame arrows which came from their enemies quivers, and ſend them back again, to their greater prejudice; and ſo may the anti-Paidobaptiſts form very ſharp weapons out of M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own Forge, though juſtly and rightly by him fabricated and aimed to another end: Neither can I ſee how it will ſerve M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s turn, nor how he ſecures himſelf againſt the reverberation and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments of their retorted weapons, when he flies to his common <hi>Aſylum</hi> and ſubterfuge, which is indeed his <hi>Clypi Septemplix,</hi> or his ſureſt backer, when they charge upon him arguments drawn from his own pen.</p>

                  <p>And though to them he anſwers, (when they collect and object from his own poſitions, that there muſt be juſtifying faith, and the firſt Grace, as pre-requiſites in perſons coming to Baptiſme) that that muſt be found either in the party himſelf; or, in the caſe of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53073:66"/>
Infants, in their parents for them; but where that ſupererrogating grant is made to the parents faith, I am yet to ſeek to make good the rights of Infants unto Baptiſme, and I believe it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>ad Calendas Graecas:</hi> But how far purity of reaſon, and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie between the old legal adminiſtrations, and the new Goſpel inſtitutions bind and oblige us, I ſhall briefly enquire into; and ſhall here take leave to digreſs ſo far. as to leave one word on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for heſitating and ſcrupulating conſciences in this particular. Whether it is ſafer to practiſe ordinances in that way, which by all hands and parties is accounted clear and obvious in their ſeveral poſitive inſtitutions, or in that way which is confeſſed to yeild moſt dark and difficult controverſie to find it out, as that about Infant Baptiſm, is, as M. <hi>Baxter</hi> himſelf moſt ingeniouſly confeſſeth, page 301. of his <hi>Plain Scripture proof,</hi> &amp;c. and in the beginning of that book more at large, to page 9. And as it is to be obſerved that if it had been lawful in Inſtitutions that relate to Worſhip (as the Sacraments are, which in themſelves are not naturally moral Ordinances, but depend wholly for vertue on the authority of the Inſtitution) to ſet them on the Rack, in all the circumſtantials of their adminiſtrations, as for manner, ſubjects, and form thereof, to anſwer all Alluſions, Types, and Analogies that may be drawn from the old Teſtament, we know not, wherein they will make a ſtop; unleſs, as in the old Law there was one viſible National church of the Jews, which had a high Prieſt over them, ſo by way of Analogie and reſemblance, the diviſible parts of the Catholique church become united in one, under one <hi>Pontifex maximus,</hi> or, in plain Engliſh, his Holineſs of Rome: So dangerous it is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to Analogies and proportions, of reaſoning from the obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete Legal adminiſtrations, which are no ways cogent or conſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to be exemplary, either in matter, form, or ſubjects of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Ordinances, which wholly depends upon the Will of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituter, who is faithful in his houſe, as was <hi>Moſes.</hi> And that is but a ſlender argument or Scar-crow of ſome, to raiſe an odium againſt their adverſaries, when they cry out with a full mouth, this is to caſt off the whole Law, and old Teſtament, at one ſtroke, whereas we generally grant, that the Law which is moral, natural, is both divine, ſpiritual, our duty, and perpetual, there is no relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the leaſt <hi>Iota</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We grant the Judicial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in many particulars for the uſe and imitation of the church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel; but for the ceremonial part of that Law, it is quite dead unto us, and is part of that hand-writing of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is nailed unto Chriſt's croſs, and to give a reſtauration and reſurrection unto it, either in its ſelf, or in alluſions drawn from it, preſſed home upon the conſcience, is to add Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Goſpel, and in effect, to lay a yoke upon the necks of the diſciples, which we nor our fathers were ever able to bear, and ſo by conſequence, to make Chriſt of none effect: For if the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53073:66"/>
Ceremonial Law, and the Judaical Judicial Law, as particularly relating to that Nation, be void, and non-obliging unto chriſtians under the Goſpel, as all ſound Proteſtants confeſs, and is this day made good and avowed by their general practiſe; for what ſort of chriſtians do ſtrictly bind themſelves up to the Judicials of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> but do pick and chuſe as they pleaſe? For as I ſaid but now, many good things are in them, both uſeful and imitable for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Commonweals to adhere to, but to make them of abſolute neceſſity, as cogent upon the conſcience, I know no ſound church or teachers does ſo undertake to become its Advocate; and if any ſhould be ſo heterodox, I am reſolved, and ſhould give it as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to others, to <hi>hold faſt that liberty wherein Chriſt hath made us free.</hi> And if the Judicial Law, together with all its Ceremonials, as all ſound Divines grant, and confeſs, and practiſe accordingly, be null, and void, and non-conſtringent unto chriſtians, then how unequal and unjuſt it is to make it a foundation or corner ſtone to build any Goſpel ordinance thereon? For the Baſis being unſound and ſandy, the ſtructure cannot hold, but muſt needs fall to the ground together: and all ſuch concluſions as are extracted from ſuch unſound premiſes, are rather exotique then concentrique with the Word of truth: For what have we to do with Legal Types and Shaddows, which are long ſince putrified in their graves? And we may ſay of them, as <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid to Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her brother <hi>Lazarus, Lord, by this it ſtinketh.</hi> We have the Anti-type, Chriſt himſelf, the true ſubſtance of all Judaical Types and Shaddows, who is the ſole Lord of his houſe, and Head of his church, who of common elements of Water, Bread, and Wine, by vertue of his Inſtitution, hath made them unto us Spiritual water of Regeneration, and Spiritual ſymbols of his Fleſh and Blood, which are myſtically and Sacramentally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to every worthy receiver; and this Lord, as a faithful Legiſlator, hath declared his will about thoſe Ordinances, about the manner of the adminiſtrations, together with the ſubjects thereof; and though ſome aſſert that the truth hereabout lies deep, and of difficult diſcerning, and I believe it true, as unto them and thoſe, by reaſon of the great duſt they themſelves raiſe about it, as the Fox in the Fable, that went to ſweep the houſe with his tail, who in ſtead of cleanſing the houſe, made it more filthy, by the duſt he raiſed about it; but for my part, I conceive theſe two great Goſpel ordinances to be plain and clear, to plain and ſimple heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chriſtians, in all the neceſſary circumſtantials thereof; as, about the manner of their adminiſtrations, the qualification of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, &amp;c. for theſe Ordinances were not inſtituted alone for phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical chriſtians, but were alſo ſubjected to the cognizance, and for the edification of all ſorts of chriſtians that were not Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks; and therefore their ſignificancy obvious unto all, in all ſuch particulars that makes but a reaſonable enquiry thereunto: and therefore I ſhould judge ſuch as Sophiſters and vain Janglers,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53073:67"/>
as go about to darken the truth of thoſe two great Goſpel lights, or Sacraments, by analogical arguments, levied from the Judicials or Ceremonials of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſupport them withal, or to evidence their truth either in themſelves, or in any circumſtantials thereof; whereas they are ſufficiently ſupported and virtuated by a clear light in themſelves, to wit, their own genuine Inſtitutions: And here rightly may be appplyed that of the Poet,
<q>—Ne te queſiveris extra—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for him that is otherwiſe minded,

                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to M. <hi>Morice,</hi> from whoſe anſwer I have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what digreſſed, I ſhall take leave to preſent him with few argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of that learned M. <hi>Baxter,</hi> being my ſelf very conſcious to be
<q>—Impar congreſſus Achilli.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his book for Infant Baptiſm, againſt M. <hi>Bedford,</hi> p. 299. this argument of his offers it ſelf. If both in the Inſtitution, and every example of Baptiſm through all the Bible, the firſt grace be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite as a condition, then the Ordinance was not inſtituted for the confirming of that firſt grace, but in the Inſtitution, and every example of Baptiſm through all the Bible, the firſt grace is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite as a condition: Therefore the Ordinance was not inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to confer it.</p>
                  <p>By the firſt Grace (it is his own words) I ſtill mean that Grace which conſiſteth in a real change of the ſoul, whether habitual or actual, or if you will call it ſeminal or radical, you may: By pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſite as a condition, I mean either in the party, or another for him.</p>
                  <p>The force of the conſequence is evident in that, otherwiſe Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm ſhould be inſtituted to give men that which is pre-required in them, and ſo which they have already, as to all them that are capable of it.</p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is undeniable, as might be manifeſted by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of the particular Texts, could we ſtay ſo long upon it. <hi>John</hi> required a profeſſion of repentance in thoſe he baptized: Jeſus firſt made them Diſciples, and then by his Apoſtles baptized them, <hi>John</hi> 4.1. The ſolemn Inſtitution of it, as a ſtanding Ordinance to the Church, which tells us fully the end is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Go and Diſciple me all Nations, Baptizing them &amp;c</hi> Now for the aged, a Diſciple and a Believer are all one, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Acts 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one &amp;c.</hi> 41. <hi>They that gladly received the Word, were baptized.</hi> Acts 8.12, 13. <hi>The Samaritans believed, and were baptized, both men and women. Simon</hi> himſelf believed, and was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53073:67"/>
baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36, 37. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt be baptized. And he anſwered, I believe &amp;c.</hi> Acts 9. <hi>Paul</hi> believed upon <hi>Ananias</hi> inſtruction, and then was baptized. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47, 48. and 16.15.33. and 18.8. and 19.4, 5, &amp;c. Thus far M. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this place. And to ſee his clearneſs herein, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and what advantage a learned man hath, when he hath Truth on his ſide: Which argument is able (though by him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged there to another end) to overturn all its oppoſites, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, That true real Grace, or as he calls it, a real change of the ſoul, is not pre-requiſite as the condition unto Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt many other arguments of his againſt M. <hi>Blake</hi>'s dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith, I ſhall only make uſe of his fourth, and fifth, and eleventh arguments page 96. of his Apologie, and refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that place for farther ſatisfaction, where there are many more arguments, both from Authority and Scriptures, levied to this purpoſe, and comporting with this Truth. His fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is,</p>
                  <p>They that are to renounce the World, Fleſh, and Divel, are to be true Believers to Juſtification; but they that are to be baptized, are then to renounce the World, Fleſh, and Divel; therefore this abrenunciation hath been practiſed alwaies in Baptiſme ſince the Apoſtles times, as Antiquity teſtifies.</p>
                  <p>His fifth argument is, They that are required to believe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, in the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, are required to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to Juſtification; But ſuch are all as come to Baptiſm, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For the <hi>major,</hi> it requires no more proof, but to explain what it is to believe in the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt; and our Divines againſt the Papiſts have enough proved, that the phraſe of believing in, comprehendeth the act of the will, as well as the underſtanding. To believe in God, is to take him for our God; which is to take him for our ſoveraign Ruler, and chief good, This none but a ſound believer can truly do.</p>
                  <p>His eleventh argument. If Baptiſm be ſolemnizing of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical marriage between Chriſt and the Baptized; then true juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith is of God required thereto: But the Antecedent is true: Therefore. Therefore it is ſaid, that we are baptized into Chriſt, and into one body: and the church hath ever held the Antecedent to be true: The conſequence is evident, in that no man but the ſound believer can truly take Chriſt as a husband and head; for ſo to do is juſtifying faith</p>
                  <p>Theſe three have I only choſen of M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s 26. arguments, to ſet, as an Antitheſis unto M. <hi>Morice</hi>'s poſitions, and as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto; and if I may ſpeak it <hi>pace tanti viri,</hi> an ill caſe is much diſadvantagious to the moſt learned man; and in this that I have ſet M. <hi>Baxter</hi> to anſwer M. <hi>Morice,</hi> is, but to ſet <hi>Socrates</hi> to anſwer <hi>Plato:</hi> And I may add one word, that whereas it is object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> faith, which was only dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and formal, though rotten in the root, gives right of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53073:68"/>
I anſwer, Firſt, It may be granted, <hi>in foro Eccleſiae;</hi> for that may be ſaid to give admiſſion to Baptiſm, &amp;c. which ſo qualifieth the perſon, as the church is bound to admit him, as being one that ſeemeth ſound in believing; for <hi>Judas</hi> was always reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the twelve, before his trayterous betraying act of his Lord and Maſter: and <hi>Simon</hi> is ſaid to have believed alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. Now the church can but give a judgement of charity, and not knowing any thing to the contrary, cannot deny admiſſion either to <hi>Simon,</hi> or any other that deſires it; for charity thinketh no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and hopeth the beſt of all: and it is an old rule, <hi>de occultis non judicat Eccleſia.</hi> But ſecondly, This is not an entituling, and having right, <hi>coram Deo, &amp; a foedere,</hi> for that alone is ſaving faith, which God in his covenant makes the condition pre-requiſite to ſuch a right of admiſſion, which is before aſſerted and proved, and that that gives right <hi>coram Deo,</hi> gives a true title alſo <hi>foro Eccleſiae;</hi> for according to a charitative judgement, they are bound to judge, that the profeſſion of faith, and wills of ſuch as deſire admiſſion, are both true, real, and ſanctified, or elſe they would not deſire it, though oftentimes the ſequel manifeſts that they are deceived therein: and hereby it is clearly evinced, that the church door is wider then the door of heaven; and that the number of the church militant, does exceed the tryumphant, and is far enlarged beyond the limits of the Elect. And herein this ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. That falſe Teachers are moſt arrogant, and pretend higheſt to gifts and miſſion.</p>
                  <p>The church of Epheſus found it ſo in their falſe Teachers, and Corinth alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. who transformed themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and who by their own mouths ſaid they were Apoſtles; they would needs get the honour of men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſpirits and callings, as the Apoſtles were, yet on tryal, they were found liars: they are of <hi>Diotrephes</hi>-like ſpirit, that would needs have the precedency, and be above <hi>John</hi> himſelf, and the true Apoſtles: <hi>Gaudent preeſſe non ut proſunt, ſed quia grande aliquid putant preeſſe, &amp; inſolentius, &amp; arrogantius principes in Eccleſia locum appertiviſse.</hi> They are like thoſe in <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.8. who ſay, <hi>We are wiſe, and the Law of the Lord is with us, while their hearts are full of lies and vanity:</hi> and as thoſe in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.6. who ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſaith, yet have ſeen nothing but a vain viſion, and a lying divination.</hi> But I ſhould here demand, why ſhould thoſe falſe teachers deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate themſelves to be Apoſtles, ſeeing the number is only limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to twelve?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Some of the ancient Fathers did denominate the firſt ſecond, and third century after Chriſt, the Apoſtolical times, though the Twelve were dead, for the purity of their doctrine, and being ſo near the fountain, as Church hiſtory manifeſts: And our Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> offers to joyn Iſſue with the Papiſts, ſo far as the fifth century, upon the authority of the Fathers, as holding the Apoſtolical doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:53073:68"/>Secondly, I anſwer, This Apoſtolical office was not ſo much the peculiar faculty of the Twelve, as to debar all others from that denomination; and though I grant they were Chriſt's Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles catexochen, yet that does not hinder, but others that are ſent, for ſo much the word ſignifies in the Greek, in Chriſt's Embaſſies unto the world, may appropriate that Title unto themſelves, as <hi>Paul</hi> very often in his Epiſtles hath juſtly vindicated his right unto it; and I know not why might not <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with others that were ſent upon the ſame meſſage with <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt, appropriate the ſame Title, and that juſtly, to themſelves alſo; for I am of opinion, that thoſe are ſtanding perpetual officers in the church, which are deſcribed in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. and are to continue it from one age to another, until the whole body of Chriſt myſtical, the elect are gathered and compleat, for ſo the words ſtrongly enforce: <hi>and he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Christ;</hi> till we all come into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt. Now whereas they object that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded, That ſome Offices in the church were only tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and for that age and ſeaſon wherein the Goſpel was firſt promulgated and planted, and for this purpoſe do urge that other text of <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>And God hath ordained ſome in his Church, as first Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, then them that do miracles, after that, the gifts of healing, helps, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diverſity of tongues:</hi> and therefore hence do argue, That becauſe ſome officers that are here numbred up, are but tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for that firſt age, as the gifts of miracles, healing, &amp;c. Therefore the Apoſtolical gift and function is ceaſed alſo with them; which was, as they ſay, for the firſt planting of the church, not for its growth and continuance.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, firſt, By diſtinguiſhing between times and perſons: and grant that Officers ſince Chriſt's time, have not that meaſure of Unction, and Spirit of infallibility, as the firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had, yet withal aſſert, that for all what the contrary minded ſay, is but <hi>petitio principii,</hi> for they only affirm, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical office was but temporary for the firſt age, but prove it not; and though they rank it up amongſt ſome of the primitive Gifts and Offices that are interr'd, yet to perſwade the ingenious, they ſhould inform where in the Temple (I mean God's Word) is their grave to be found? They may from this laſt Scripture as juſtly argue, that the gifts and functions of Teachers, Prophets, Helps, and Governments, are alſo ceaſed in the church, becauſe the gifts of healing, miracles, &amp;c. are ceaſed, in and amongſt which cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue they are alſo ranked.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Tenent of the Opponents is the ready way, and I preſume, had a great influence of late in hatching and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53073:69"/>
the ſect of the Seekers, and anti-Scripturiſts: for when it is aſſerted and maintained by the reputed Orthodox, that moſt of the primitive offices, as Apoſtles, gifts of Miracles, Healings, &amp;c. are ceaſed to the church, under the defection and falling away by the riſe of antichriſt: They forthwith rejoyn and object; Why? If ſome gifts are evacuated in the church, and no vertue in them, as you confeſs, why not the reſt of the ſame foundation and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, as well as they? and ſo upon the ſame grounds that ſome are ceaſed, they pertinaciouſly affirm, that all other offices and ordinances are null and defunct alſo, being only for that age and miniſtration; and to that end, do interpret that promiſe of Chriſt's ſpiritual ſupport and preſence with his Church, in the laſt of <hi>Matthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> That he would be with them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we render, to the end of the world, or all generations: yet they for their own intereſt, render, to the end of that age; and ſo conſequentially, deny the Word, and Ordinances, and the Being of a church: for how ſhould there be a church, without VVord and Ordinances? and how ſhould the VVord and Ordinances be adminiſtred without Officers? according to that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>How ſhall they believe unleſs they hear? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they preach, unleſs they be ſent?</hi> This hath been the ſad conſequence of aſſerting that relaxation of ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and gifts in the church, and not evidencing where their graves lie, or their repeals.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, That <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, &amp;c. is ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing for the contrary; for all thoſe offices that are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, which Chriſt gave unto the church, there is not the leaſt intimation that ſome were for the church then in being, of that preſent age, and the reſt for futurity to continue; but rather the contrary is evinced: <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, &amp;c. Cuibono?</hi> To what end? For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, &amp;c. Now I would anti-query, Are the Saints all perfected? Is the work of the Miniſtry at an end? Is the church, the body of Chriſt, ſo ſufficiently edified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that they are all come to the unity of faith, and to perfect knowledge, and to a full meaſure and ſtature of Chriſt? I hope none will affirm it, unleſs the Perfectiſts, and Quakers.</p>
                  <p>But here again they will ſay, VVe grant ordinary Officers, as Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, &amp;c. are ſtill continued in the church for this work, until we all come to be a perfect man in Chriſt, but extraordinary officers, as Apoſtles, &amp;c. are ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer again, This is aſſerted, and not proved, therefore it is a begging of the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I affirm, That thoſe which are called the ſtanding ordinary officers, as Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, &amp;c. were in their firſt inſtitution of an extraordinary Spirit, and of the ſame Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though differing in meaſure with the Apoſtles themſelves, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53073:69"/>
ſomtimes Apoſtles, Paſtors, and Elders, were taken as Synonima's, though really differing amongſt themſelves in gifts and offices; as to inſtance, <hi>James</hi> the firſt Paſtor or Biſhop of Jeruſalem, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a pillar and an Apoſtle. <hi>John,</hi> the great and beloved Apoſtle, is in his Epiſtle called the Elder. And in that great Synodical aſſembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. the Elders are in joynt commiſſion with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and being men of an extraorindary ſpirit alſo, as appears by all thoſe of the firſt unction, as <hi>Stephen, Ananias, Barnabas,</hi> &amp;c. and the reſt of the brethren who went abroad upon the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the church, and preached, and wrought miracles every where, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But here ſome may ſay, this is to level all officers, and to make the Apoſtles themſelves but of equal authority with the ordinary offices of Paſtors, Teachers, Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Not at all; for though I grant ſome purity in their gifts, being both extraordinary in their firſt unction, yet the firſt twelve, in ſome acts of their offices, were to excel all others, as is evident by <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22. when the eleven choſe <hi>Matthias</hi> into <hi>Judas</hi> Biſhoprick; <hi>Peter</hi> urged that one muſt be ordained to be a witneſs with them of the Reſurrection, that was converſant with them from the baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> to the time of Chriſt's reſurrection: as this was a great part of their office, to bear witneſs of the life, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt unto the world; and this they could atteſt as truth, as eye witneſſes, being with Jeſus all the time he went in and out amongſt them; and herein they ſurpaſſed all others that came after. Secondly, They excel all other officers, in that they had their commiſſion immediately from Chriſt, to convert, diſciple, and baptize all Nations into the faith; but all other officers had it derivatively from them. Thirdly, They had the pre-eminence in gifts, of miracles, which was moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjoyned to their Miniſtery for the confirmation of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But it is very inconſequent that the whole Apoſtolique office is quite ceaſed to the church, becauſe ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent gifts and endowments of that office, as it was in the Apoſtles of the firſt inſtitution, are ceaſed, which only indeed was tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and neceſſary alone for the firſt plantation of the Chriſtian faith; it will as well follow, that Paſtors, Teachers, and Elders, are defunct, becauſe ſome of their firſt primitive and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gifts are ceaſed alſo.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, I am of opinion, that what is neceſſarily eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to denominate an Apoſtle, did not conſiſt ſolely in being eye-witneſſes of Chriſt's, life, death, and reſurrection, or of power of miracles; for others of the Diſciples might be partakers in thoſe gifts, and were ſo equally with themſelves, and yet no Apoſtles; and <hi>Paul</hi> that wanted much of the accomodation of witneſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the life, death, and reſurrection of Chriſt, though ſupplyed by a miraculous ſight from heaven, none can deny but was the great Apoſtle, and light unto the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53073:70"/>Laſtly, In the affirmative, I aſſert the true eſſentials of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, does conſiſt in his Call and Commiſſion to that work and function: Chriſt calls the firſt twelve, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.1.5. which were only denominated Diſciples, and from their miſſion unto the loſt ſheep of Iſrael, they were then firſt baptized into the name of Apoſtles, and ſo having taken their names from their office, as men ſent, it ſoon became their proper appellations. Now (I ſay) it is a right miſſion and commiſſion, that gives a being and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially unto an Apoſtle: Chriſt, he was the firſt author that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated unto this office; in that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. his commiſſion was more ſtrict, and of narrower juriſdiction; but in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. it was much enlarged; for in the firſt, they were only to go to the loſt ſheep of Iſrael, and not in the way of the Gentiles: but in the ſecond, they were commanded to go and Diſciple all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to preach the Goſpel to every creature. Now as they were ſent on this great Embaſſie for Chriſt, and by Chriſt; ſo they ſend others to go on with the ſame work: <hi>Matthias</hi> was the firſt we read of, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. that they choſe into the place of <hi>Judas:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> Acte 13.2, 3. were choſen, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated unto this work, and ſent unto the Gentiles; and ſo might be truly called the Apoſtles of the Gentiles: They again, with the reſt of the Apoſtles in their ſeveral Provinces, went about, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſtituting churches, and ordaining Elders, and officers in every church; and thoſe political churches made up of Officers and Elders, and Members, were the true Delegates of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the center of all juſt power and authority; and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from this delegated power, commiſſionates others, and ſends them forth as the Apoſtles of Chriſt, by vertue of that power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, to diſciple the Gentiles, and unconverted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abroad in the world; for this was the then practiſe, unleſs we affirm, that all churches were planted, and all Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Apoſtles themſelves in their days, that we read of in hiſtory, were afterward converted to the faith, and became fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous churches. The Apoſtles were men but of one generation, and to aſcribe to them that work, were to make them eviternal. Though their Doctrine continue, yet their perſons are tranſlated, and gone to their Fathers; and this propagation of the faith, and work of converſion muſt be carried on from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, till all the Elect be called in, and we all come to a perfect man, and unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, and this muſt neceſſarily be done by Apoſtolical men and officers: For I would have the ingenious to conſider, that the offices of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Paſtors, Teachers, Helps, and Governments, are but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Functions, and have their being only dependant and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their relations and churches: they are neither Elders, Paſtors, nor Governents without their own churches, therefore it is very neceſſary that there muſt be other officers, univerſally commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to preach the Goſpel to the unconverted Gentiles: and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53073:70"/>
theſe are properly called Apoſtles of Chriſt, authorized by the church of Chriſt unto this ſervice. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of Arimethea, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity teſtifies, was our Engliſh Apoſtle, which was ſent by the church unto our Nations converſion. <hi>Dioniſius Areopagita</hi> was the Apoſtle unto <hi>France. James</hi> unto <hi>Spain. Anthony</hi> unto <hi>Italy. Thomas</hi> unto <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo others unto other Nations: And when chriſtianity was almoſt loſt and obliterated here in <hi>England,</hi> by the incurſions of barbarous Nations, <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Biſhop of Rome, not yet Antichiſtianized, ſome centuries of years after, ſent here <hi>Auſtin</hi> as an Apoſtle, and a Reſtorer of their almoſt loſt faith, and chriſtian profeſſion. So likewiſe when our churches ſend men to convert the Gentile Nations of <hi>America,</hi> and elſewhere, as private Diſciples they cannot go; for <hi>how can they preach, unleſs they be ſent?</hi> as Officers, to wit, as Paſtors, Elders, Teachers, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents they cannot; for they are relations only to their own churches: therefore they muſt go as Apoſtles, which is only ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſo general and univerſal work.</p>
                  <p>And if it be objected, That if the Apoſtolical offices muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as neceſſary to do the full work of Chriſt and his church, why not the gifts of healings, miracles, tongues? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There is no necſſity for it; for they were only added becauſe of unbelief, and to confirm the truth of that doctrine which was firſt delivered unto the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I am not ſenſible what great inconveniencies will follow upon it, if it were admitted, that ſuch gifts of miracles, healings, &amp;c. are ſtill continued by Chriſt unto his church, though not ſo clear and ordinary as in the firſt churches. I have read of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and after him <hi>Cyprian,</hi> about the ſecond century, who provokes their adverſaries to the tryal of the truth of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by miracles, by bringing perſons poſſeſſed with divels into their aſſemblies; which if they ſhould not be effected, and made to confeſs themſelves to be divels, and Chriſt to be the Son of God, then they were content to ſuffer.</p>

Of which ſort (ſaith he)ſome think that really they did ſo by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, as we may do now by faſting and prayer ſomtimes: To this purpoſe, conſider what the prayers and appeals of God's people have ſtrangely and miraculouſly perfected and produced at the hands of God, of late, and within our memories, in divers examples, which is now too long to rehearſe: Some have been reſtored to health, and miraculouſly recovered, when there was no hope: others diſpoſſeſſed of evil ſpirits, that had palpably vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and poſſeſſed them, and that only by the prayers of faith of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53073:71"/>
ſomg odly perſons. I ſhall only give one inſtance; I heard it related by a faithful meſſenger of Chriſt, in a publique Sermon in the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> to wit, M. <hi>Lewis Steukley,</hi> a workman that need not be aſhamed, who occaſionally in that diſcourſe, ſpoke of a great man's Steward in Scotland really poſſeſſed with the Divel, who was tormented ſo ſore many days, that his tongue was ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len without his mouth, to that magnitude and extenſiveneſs, that it was impoſſible for him to bring it in, or contain it within his mouth, and ſo thereby was utterly deprived of all uſe of ſpeech; yet however in that horrid poſture, and ſpeechleſs, there was a clear diſtinct voice heard within him, ſaying unto that Miniſter that Miniſter that came to viſit the poſſeſſed party, being his neighbour, That he might ſave his pain, for that the perſon poſſeſſed was his own: To whom the Miniſter anſwered, I cannot believe thee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, for thou haſt been a lyar from the beginning. Then the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or voice within would anſwer again, Be gone, for he is mine. To whom the Miniſter replyed, If Chriſt died for him, thou haſt no intereſt in him; and I will try with my God by prayer, to prove thee a lyar, Satan: Whereupon he departed, and left the party miſerably extorted and tormented: and as he was in his way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his houſe, it was in his thoughts to pitch upon ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain faithful chriſtians to joyn with him, and aſſiſt him in this duty to God, on the behalf of the poſſeſſed party, and to ſend for them as ſoon as he returned: But obſerve the providence, when as he came unto his houſe, he found all theſe perſons there, coming on other accounts to ſpeak with him, which he in his thoughts had in the way pitched on; when he ſaw that, he admired and bleſſed God for the providence, and preſently told them, that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forthwith to ſend for them all in particular, to aſſiſt him in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and prayer to God for the recovery and releaſement of ſuch a perſon poſſeſſed by Satan, and would try their intereſt with God for him, and on his behalf: they gladly heard it, and entertained the motion, and ſo continued that evening ſome hours together, very fervent in prayer; and after the duty performed, they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to their ſeveral reſts. The next morning very early, the party poſſeſſed came to the Miniſter, well compoſed, and ſenſible, and his tongue reſtored to his wonted bigneſs and ſtation, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Miniſter plainly and diſtinctly, that he wreſtled with God for him; for he affirmed, by his prayers he was healed and delivered from the evil one that vexed him: The Miniſter demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, By what time he had releaſement? He anſwered, by ſuch a time in the precedent evening: by which the Miniſter found, it ſwas about the ſame time he was in prayer to God for him; and ſo both Miniſter and party gave glory to God for it. This was the ſum of the ſtory, and he avouched he had it from a godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his acquaintance, who received it from the Miniſter's own mouth that was the actor of it: and coming from ſo ſerious and godly man, and eſpecially in the publique exerciſe, it deſerves as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53073:71"/>
much of an hiſtorical faith, as any ſtory of like kind whatſoever. And why the church ſhould now want miracles, I know not, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the primitive chriſtians had that abundance of them; if it is not, becauſe that the church of Rome have of late ſo cheated the world with ſo many legends of them, that we will now give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to none, becauſe there are ſo many falſe ones coyned, and ſo by reaſon of our little faith, we are deprived of them.</p>
                  <p>But to return, that I may not ſeem ſingular in this opinion of the continuation of Apoſtles in the church of Chriſt, which I preſs not as a matter of neceſſary faith, but dogmatically only, I ſhall recite ſome of good authority, to defend me from the cenſure of ſingularity herein; but for ſuch opinions as are only converſant about the accidentals of Religion, I would have that of the Poet recognized,

                  <p>And firſt D. <hi>Hammond Reſolv.</hi> 6. <hi>page</hi> 351. aſſerted, That in the primitive times, Biſhops were uſually called Apoſtles, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, that the notion Apoſtles is not always taken properly or ſtrictly to be underſtood. And M. <hi>Parker Of the Croſs,</hi> part 2. 126. affirms, That the ancient church extended the Apoſtolical times beyond the age of the Apoſtles, even to the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel: and therefore ſome Authors, and perſons of antiquity, are ſaid to live <hi>Temporibus Apostolorum,</hi> in the time of the Apoſtles, that lived about 300. years after Chriſt; and our Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> admits of theſe firſt five centuries of years after Chriſt, to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical, pure, and uncorrupted, for the main: and therefore I cannot ſee what diſadvantage or inconvenience can happen to the church of Chriſt, by the entertainment of this dogmatical point and tenet, but rather much many ways by want thereof; for as I ſaid before, what general or univerſal officer doth the church now enjoy, that can rightly preach abroad to the converſion of the Gentile Nations in the world, unleſs under the notion and office of an Apoſtle? for all other ordinary officers are meerly relatives, and cannot move or act authoritatively, beyond their own proper ſpheres and relations, to wit, their flocks and churches; unleſs they will hereby inevitably grant a liberty of propheſie to all gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, and ſo rank themſelves amongſt thoſe that do it only <hi>virtute doni non authoritatis,</hi> unto the unconverted world; and to acknowledge that it is only done <hi>virtute doni,</hi> is to ſlight the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the church, and tacitely to conclude, that the church hath no power in it to confer ſuch an office, whereby Chriſt may be publiquely taught unto the Gentile or Heatheniſh world; for it is clear, that the preaching of the Word unto the world, is an act of authority, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. for <hi>how ſhall they preach, unleſs they be ſent?</hi> and to propheſie, interpret, or preach the Word, <hi>virtute doni,</hi> was only a relative duty, and permitted and exerciſed within the church aſſemblies only, that I can collect
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53073:72"/>
either from the practiſe of the firſt churches in the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, or their Epiſtles; and therefore all that were ſent to the converſion of the Ethnick world, were ſent ordinarily from the church (ſome extraordinary caſes only excepted, which never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts unto a rule) in the notion of Apoſtles, as was <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> &amp;c. and for want of the continuation of theſe ordinary officers in the church, we are enforced to maintain heterodoxical opinions concerning the authority, the power of preaching, miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. and in effect, conclude with the Papiſts, that there muſt be an univerſal Biſhop, or at leaſt as abſurdly, univerſal Elders, Paſtors, Teachers, Miniſters, being meerly relatives, that muſt have power over the whole world. From the diſcourſed premiſes, I ſhall only add this argument, If the word cannot lawfully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily be preached to the converſion of the world, either by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate chriſtians or officers now at preſent authorized in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, meerly as ſuch officers, then ſurely there are ſome officers wanting unto the churches, by which it may be rightly diſpenſed. But the <hi>major</hi> being formerly cleared, the conſequence I believe none will deny, that looks upon the preaching of the word as an act of authority and office: therefore the concluſion is evident.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to ſhut up this diſcourſe, I am very much of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that all primitive offices and officers which were of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inſtitutions in the Apoſtles times, are moral poſitive laws, and ſtill conſtringent and perpetual, unleſs you can ſhow their repeals. See <hi>Cawdry</hi> on the Sabbath, <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. hereon, and therefore binding unto the church in all ages. Confer hereunto that of <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. All which indeed the church doth virtually and implicitely maintain, though they have laid by the names thereof, ſo neceſſary do they find the acts of the ſaid offices, though the offices themſelves nominally are thruſt out of doors: When we ſend Preachers to our American plantations for the diſcipling the poor Indians, are they not tantamount as Apoſtles? When <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> the centuriſts, and later Church Hiſtoriographers, do hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the acts and occurrences of the church, are they not in a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified ſenſe Evangeliſts, when perſons do interpret and enucleate dark or prophetical Scriptures, do they not look like Prophets? When by the faith and prayers of the faithful, corruptions are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, the will's reformed, health reſtored, and Satanical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions accompliſhed, do they not carry the face of miracles? And why then ſhould we not entertain the offices and gifts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nominally as well as operatively and virtually, though with ſome mark of diſtinction, as by a creſcent, as unto younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; acknowledging always, and that juſtly, a pre-eminence of gifts and ſpirit in thoſe of the firſt age, and neareſt unto the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life and verity; but far thereby from concluding that their offices were buried with the firſt founders, together with their moſt excellent gifts in one arme, but ſtill kept alive and preſerved for the good of the Church, and the perfecting of the Saints, for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53073:72"/>
the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtation of the fulneſs of Chriſt. And that none may judge me raſh or preſumptory in this opinion, I ſubmit it to the tryal of Chriſt's churches, and add,
<q>Adhuc ſub Judice lis eſt,</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Try all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> Let every one be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded fully in his own mind, and in the mean to walk in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of light that he hath attained unto.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, the queſtion may be ſeaſonably ſet, how ſhall we know or try falſe Apoſtles from true? Chriſt's miniſters from antichriſt's? or the pſeudo-prophets from the Orthodox? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the falſe ones can transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and ſay they are Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt, as well as true ones, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p>This queſtion indeed is worthy the diſcuſſion, uſeful both for the rectifying of the private judgement of diſcretion, as well as of the publique authoritative judgement of the church in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; for indeed it is no new thing, nor ſtrange to the pureſt churches of God, to have falſe Prophets, and falſe Apoſtles in them. In the days of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.19. the prophets of Baal were four hundred and fifty, and of the Groves, four hundred; but the true ones hid by <hi>Obadiah</hi> were but one hundred, <hi>Ezekiel, Jeremiah,</hi> met them too in Babylon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 28, 29 chap. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.2, 3. The Apoſtolique primitive churches were much troubled and vexed with falſe Apoſtles, falſe prophets, and falſe teachers alſo, witneſs 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.11. and thoſe churches of Epheſus, Pergamus, Sardis, &amp;c. had their ſhare alſo in this trouble, by the doctrine of Balaam, Nicolaitans, Jezabel, &amp;c. and this God often ſuffers, with the ſad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, in and upon his churches, to make the Truth more clear and precious, to try the godly, and diſcover hypocrites, and to ſhew his power and wiſdom, that can produce good out of evil, and preſerve his undefiled in the midſt of contagions; but the wiſdom of the Saints is to try them, and diſcover them, that ſo they may be avoided, with all their malignant influences, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious doctrines.</p>
                  <p>Now a falſe Apoſtle or Prophet may be diſcovered two ways: Firſt, Either from his falſe doctrine or propheſie: Or ſecondly, From his falſe call or miſſion. The ancient Prophets of God, were called Seers, from the clear divine revelations and irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had of the mind of God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.13. and this was called the Gift of Propheſie. Next, They had a clear call to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that Gift. But the falſe Prophets, they propheſied out of their own hearts, and follow their own ſpirits, and have ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53073:73"/>
as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.2, 3. that is, They are Prophets, becauſe they will be Prophets; it is their own motion that makes them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, they thruſt themſelves upon it, and make their own wills the higheſt original of their call; and therefore in the next place, the things they propheſie are their own; what their fancies, luſts, private intereſts, affections, and carnal reaſon ſuggeſt unto them, ſo their propheſies come by the will of man, not of God, as that of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and therefore however eſteemed and magnified by men, is worthleſs in God's account; becauſe it only proceeds from their own ſpirits, and not from God's Spirit, the true Spirit of propheſie. Now I would not here be miſtaken, as if I preſſed for enthuſiaſtique propheſies, but to keep cloſe to that Spirit of propheſie in the Word of God, which will not cloſe with man's baſe intereſts and motions, but is according to the will of God in all things; and this is the true ſpirit of propheſie: and therefore what comes from the will of man, and private Spirits, are in the Scriptures variouſly branded, under the Titles of lies, dreams, vain divinations, perverſe things, the commandments of men, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7. wiſdom of this world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. another Jeſus, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit, another Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 4. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> durſt not preach any other thing but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and what he had from him by his Spirit, that he preached unto them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. Therefore we may plainly judge a falſe Prophet or Apoſtle, when he comes with doctrines, and propheſies of his own motions, and own Spirit, and own deſigns, being oppoſite and deſtructive to the Spirits doctrine of faith and godlineſs within the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But will not ſome ſay, that all heretiques, falſe apoſtles, and falſe Teachers, will come with <hi>verbum Domini</hi> in their mouth, and pretend highly, that their doctrines are concordant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word of God, or elſe in vain to broach and atteſt them? And who more high then they in this particular; witneſs the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſh Sect, with their many pretended miracles, voluminous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, Traditions, ſuper-numerary Sacraments, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs it is the common trade with all new and falſe doctrine-mongers, to amuſe the vulgar with their intricate Scriptural gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſo thereby they may the better ſwallow down the hook or poiſon undiſcovered, within the artificially compoſed bait and pill: and as the fiſh <hi>Sepia</hi> darkens the water with its inky humour, to avoid the hand of the Fiſher, ſo do theſe ſerpentine Fry ſo cloud the truth with their polemical diſcourſes, that unawares they have brought many heretical Syncretiſmes upon the church of God under the pretence of Scriptural truths and reaſons: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their high pretence to Scripture and Reaſon, both are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined by them, and have endeavoured the overthrow thereof, by their ſtrange concluſions, which are both falſe and oppoſite to the truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Now underſtand that I hold not that every difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53073:73"/>
about the externals or accidentals of Religion, is ſufficient to denominate the holder thereof a heretique, or falſe Teacher, for then which of the Fathers would go clear, nor but few (if any) of their Succeſſors? But that truly and really denominates a heretique or falſe teacher, is the holding and maintaining ſuch errors, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſtrike at, and will ſubvert the foundation. Now this is the foundation article, That ye believe in God, and in Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent; for this is life eternal, <hi>John</hi> 17 3. And that doctrine that ſtrikes at this, either directly or conſequentially, is hereſie, and falſe doctrine: and therefore juſtly were they called falſe Apoſtles, that went about to add Circumciſion unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and ſaid they could not be ſaved without it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. This was to nullifie Chriſt's ſacrifice and ſatisfaction, and to make Chriſt of none effect, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Galathians, <hi>That hereby they hearken to a new Goſpel:</hi> Therefore it is of plain and eaſie diſcernment, for a competent ſpiritualized Chriſtian, to make diſcovery of a falſe Apoſtle, Prophet, falſe Teacher, or Heretique, by the doctrine he brings. For firſt, If it ſtrike at the root, or tends to the ſubverſion of the true fear of God and godlineſs, it is of Satan, and from hell. Next, If it ſtrikes directly or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially at the ſubverſion of Chriſt in any of his offices, be ſure that doctrine is not of God; for there is no name, way, or practiſe under heaven, whereby we may be ſaved, but in the name and faith of Chriſt, who is the alone way unto the Father, and none cometh unto him, but in and by the Son; all other ways are not only broken reeds, but dangerous; this only in the Son is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the next place, falſe Apoſtles and Teachers may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from their falſe calls or miſſions; and this will the better be evinced, by firſt conſidering its contrary; the right Call of true and faithful Teachers and Apoſtles of Chriſt; and their Call was either firſt from God; or ſecondly, from the church: God's call is by giving abilities, gifts, and affections, ſutable to the work and office that he ordains him for: <hi>He gave ſome Apostles; ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſome Evangeliſts,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo when God ſent <hi>Moſes,</hi> he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him for the great work he appointed him to. <hi>Moſes</hi> pleads his unaptneſs and ſlowneſs of ſpeech; but God ſaid, <hi>Go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee, &amp;c.</hi> Exod. 4.12. and ſo unto all the Prophets of old, God came with his Spirit upon them, and filled them with a ſufficiency thereof, before they were ſent upon their errands: God calls Apoſtles of Fiſhers, and makes them Fiſhers of men, and ſo ſpirits them; and enables them, that they fear not the faces of men; nor the learned of the world; for he tells them, <hi>Go preach, and lo I am with you to the end of the world;</hi> that is, by a peculiar aſſiſtance, by his grace, ſtrength; comfort, direction, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Thoſe that Chriſt calls and ſends, he gives them a full ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all gifts and graces neceſſary to diſcharge their reſpective ſervices; Secondly, God's call gives affections and heart unto
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53073:74"/>
the work; he moves ſtrongly, by a ſecret impulſe of Spirit on the ſoul that he ſends on his employments: it will not conſult with fleſh and blood, but will on, as <hi>Paul</hi> did in the work of the Lord, without heſitating or ſecuring his carnal intereſts. Yet ſecondly, This call muſt proceed orderly unto the exerciſe thereof, ſince extraordinary Gifts and Calls are ceaſed; the mediate call muſt concur, to ſet the ſeal and authority upon the firſt. God's giving to a man the call of abilities, parts, and affections to an office, do not really, and <hi>ipſo facto</hi> inveſt him in that office; it maybe ſaid that he hath <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but not <hi>jus in re;</hi> he hath a potential right thereunto, but not a right of poſſeſſion: for Chriſt hath delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that power unto his church, of ſetting their publique Signature upon all Officers for his ſervice: for whom God qualifies with a call of abilities, he is only judged and deemed fit for the Miniſtry of Chriſt, but not really a Miniſter or Officer of Chriſt, before he is ordained thereunto by the church: by the firſt call only he may perform many good duties and ſervices unto the church, as an able and faithful Diſciple, or member; but by the conjunction of the other, he can do it <hi>ex officio,</hi> and authoritatively. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as pretend their call to publique offices, as Apoſtles, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Paſtors, &amp;c. only as from God, and contemn the other from the church; ſurely I am of judgement, as unto their miſſion, they are falſe Apoſtles, and are neither called of God nor man; for if their call of abilities was from God, as they boaſt of, then it would manifeſt it ſelf to be of God, by a ſubmitting to the wiſdom of God, in the order of the diſpenſation of his Ordinances in his word: Therefore both conjunct together, makes up a compleat officer, and ſhining ſtar within the church.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, Thoſe that boaſt of their callings from the church, and want the firſt call of God of abilities, they are good for nothing, but as unſavoury ſalt, to be caſt unto the dung, uſeleſs to any ſervice; they will not ſerve ſo much as to make a pin in the houſe of God; ſuch are falſe Apoſtles to the purpoſe, fit to be ſpewed out of all Chriſtian churches in the world. Wherefore all faithful chriſtian aſſemblies, ſhould have a ſpecial care not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſuch who can only manifeſt their call from man, and not from God, in competent gifts and parts fit for ſo high a calling: They cannot work at all to edification in the Lord's houſe, for they want ſupplies to that end: We know an Artificer can do little work without his tools or inſtruments; but unto thoſe who ſhould be employed about ſpiritual buildings, if God hath denied the inſtrumentality of his Spirit, be ſure that in ſtead of a Zion, ſuch will erect a Babel; and being ignorant where the green paſtures of the Goſpel lies, they will (like idle Shepherds) either ſtarve the ſheep of their flocks, or at leaſt poyſon them with unwholſome herbage. And theſe I account as ſufficient rules to try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine falſe Apoſtles and Teachers by, and to find them liars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But an Objection may here ariſe from him that hath the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53073:74"/>
firſt call of abilities from God; That if I count it ſo neceſſary for him to denominate him Orthodox in his call, to have the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal call of the church alſo: But then (ſaith he) to what church ſhall I repair to receive this call, ſeeing there are ſo many that are pretenders to be the true and right churches of Chriſt, and that the alone ordaining authority is in them, and not in others.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed <hi>locus lubricus,</hi> a ſlippery queſtion, and I ſhould be loth to deal with it, leſt I ſhould offend the contrary minded, by ventilating my judgement herein; but I profeſs ingeniouſly, it was neither men, nor parties, ſelf intereſts, nor by-affections, that did lead me firſt to this undertaking, but only the general good of chriſtians, unto which the Lord moved my heart, with much ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of Spirit, being clearly unbyaſſed, and not ſo over-much engaged to any of the new parties of theſe times, but that I can reſerve my judgement free to cloſe with truth, whereſoever I can find it. And therefore I think it not amiſs, but to proſecute my firſt intendment, in the ſingleneſs of heart, to endeavour to clear up truth, according to the ſcantle of my judgement, not as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the clouds, but in plainneſs, and perſpicuity, though for my reward, I may have his hire that traced truth ſo near at the heels, that had his teeth daſhed out for his pains; but if I be a fool here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet being reputed a fool, for the promotion of truth, it will be ſome comfort; and if I ſuffer loſs herein, yet this conſideration will conſolate: <hi>Magnis tamen excidit Auſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt then to the buſineſs, Underſtand that the word Church in Scripture is ordinarily taken (to avoid all criticizing upon the word) to be the company of the faithful gathered out of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the miniſtry of the Word and Spirit; and this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the genuine definition of the church; which may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly be made good both by good authority and Scripture. Now this church is either more improperly, firſt, called the inviſible church: or ſecondly, more properly, the viſible church. The inviſible church comprehends only the elect; and ſeeing their number to us are unknown, therefore they are denominated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. But ſecondly, The viſible church is either to be taken for the viſible univerſal catholique church, or ſecondly, for a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible particular political church. Now the queſtion is concerning the church in this laſt notion; for 'tis apparent, the inviſible church as inviſible, hath not to do in viſible and outward ordinances: Neither ſecondly, the viſible univerſal church can by themſelves or others, their repreſentatives, convene for the inſtitution of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; for how can it ſtand with conveniency, or with the leaſt ſhew of reaſonableneſs, that all the churches of Chriſt diſperſed and planted in the various and far diſtant corners and Ilands of the world, ſhould either by themſelves, or their repreſenting Officers, meet together in one catholique aſſembly, for the diſpoſing and conferring of all mediate calls and Offices? And therefore Chriſt hath ordained that All wiſe order and gubernation in and over his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53073:75"/>
myſtical body the church, that every part of this univerſal body, I mean every particular chriſtian aſſembly of the church catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique (for every particular is part of the whole) ſhould have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own limits and juriſdiction, a full power to exerciſe all the offices and ordinances which Chriſt hath given and inſtituted for the good and edification of his church unto the end of the world. Neither is the church to be called catholique, in reſpect of any her Officers (for we know no ſuch office ſince the firſt Apoſtles, that were ſo extraordinary gifted) as to have the denomination of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique authority over the univerſal church, though they may be accounted to have <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> fit to be officers of any parts of the catholique church, and ſo to have a potential right thereunto, yet actual they have not, before their particular calls does inveſt them into <hi>Jus in re,</hi> as well as their gifts and abilities does to <hi>Jus ad rem.</hi> But the profeſſion of that catholique univerſal faith, which is one and the ſame in all churches over the whole world, that gives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to the univerſal or catholique church; therefore the reſults and concluſions of combined Churches, Provincial or National, may be only admitted as prudentially binding and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging, as Eccleſiaſtical Laws and Canons, but not as having a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority ſtamped upon them, though agreeable to the divine truth it ſelf; ſo that ſuch conſtitutions are to be received and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, not ſolely, <hi>virtute authoritatis convocation is, ſed virtute ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis propoſitae;</hi> which if the ſame concluſions were enjoyned by a particular chriſtian political church, were to be received by all of that church, not only for the truths ſake therein, but in ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the divine authority of the church that commands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes them; Such is the difference between prudential Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtique Edicts, and Eccleſiaſtique divine Inſtitutions; the one is humane, and binding only prudentially, the other is divine, and obligeth conſcienciouſly.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations being cleared, I come to anſwer the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to what particular viſible church muſt a candidate apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a mediate authoritative call and miſſion, to receive it rightly, and according to the mind of God, and ſatisfaction of a good Conſcience?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, and take leave here firſt to diſtinguiſh and take notice between the <hi>bene eſse,</hi> and the <hi>eſſe</hi> of a call. There may be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular churches which I cannot deny but to be truly churches of Chriſt, but not true ones; that is, they may have being in Chriſt by faith, as branches in the Vine, yet mixed with much rottenneſs and unſoundneſs; and as a leprous perſon is a man, yet a ſorry one, ſo a church holding the faith, which is as the ſoul and life thereof, yet entertaining much corruption and errour, may be truly called a chriſtian church, but a ſad one: So the Miniſterial call does an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the conſtitution of the churches from whence they proceed.

So the church of <hi>Rome</hi> (though by ſome too favourably acknowledged to be truly a church, though not a true one) having not only forſaken her firſt love, but having committed adultery, and ſpiritual fornication with the Kings of the earth, and the inhabitants of the earth being made drunk with the wine of her fornication, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2. now ſhe that hath played the part of ſo notorious a harlot, as that ſhe is entituled in Scripture, v. 5. <hi>The mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth, the great Whore, Babylon the great, &amp;c.</hi> how ſuch a church, or rather, antichriſtian Synagogue, ſhould give an eſſence to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian officers and ordinances, it cannot enter into my judgement or conſcience to conclude, though otherwiſe extenſive enough in charity to erroneous and backſliding churches, and ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and approve whatſoever of truth and God is in them. But that which is moſt admirable to conſider in this adulterate Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church, is, that God hath ſo far infatuated her ſpiritual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding, that of all thoſe offices and officers we read in the Goſpel, that Chriſt hath inſtituted for the work of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and perfecting of the Saints, we can hear but of one, to wit, Biſhops; and that too, with moſt abundant Prelatical cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the whole Apocryphal catalogue of the officers of the Synagogue of Rome; where is it aſſerted in Scripture of a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary monſtrous head of the church to be a Pope? Where ſhall you read of thoſe Princely Cardinals in the whole Treaſury of God's Word? In what page of his word ſhall you find the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Titles of Archbiſhops, Lord Abbots, Archdeacons, &amp;c? Where ſhall we find it recorded in holy Writ, of all the reſt of the rabble, and ſupernumerary officers of this harlot church, as Deans, Canons, Prebends, Surrogates, Prieſts, Abbots, Abbeſſes, Friers,

Nuns, Doctors, Proctors, Sumners, <hi>cum multis aliis &amp;c?</hi> And again, hath not this adultereſs, inſtead of thoſe ſpurious Iſſues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpewed out of her boſome the ſound and orthodox offices and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Chriſt? As where ſhall you hear in all her Egyptian or Babyloniſh Territory, the ſound of thoſe Goſpel officers, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, Teachers, Elders, Biſhops rightly qualified, &amp;c? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſure ſhame unto all ſuch that will own a derivation of office and call from ſuch a church, that hath not only baniſhed ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers out of her juriſdiction, as are truly Chriſt's, but is become her ſelf an adultereſs, and the mother of harlots, and alſo the Throne of Antichriſt; and yet if any for all this will endeavour to avouch their calls and miſſions good, as unto the eſſentials thereof from the church of Rome; they muſt in the firſt place maintain, that ſhe is truly a church of Chriſt, as unto the eſſence at leaſt, and to ſeparate and depart from ſuch a church, I know not how they can defend it without ſin; therefore either be ſo ingenious as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be a true eſſential chriſtian church, and juſtifie your calls therefrom, and hold communion with her, or elſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her to be the Synagogue of Satan, and of Antichriſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all her dependencies of miſſions, calls, and ordinances, which at beſt are but antichriſtian, and therefore worthily to be rejected, removed, and loathed of all true chriſtian hearts: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we have a command for it; <hi>Come out of her my people:</hi> and I pray, how ſhall we depart or come out of her, if we communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with her in her holy things? Indeed, ingenious M. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms, if the Pope be Antichriſt, the caſe is clear, as the good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>Downam, Jewel, &amp;c.</hi> hath evinced. See his Worceſterſhire agreement, p. 69, and 70.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected, How then ſhould the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers that fell off from Rome, have a right call to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial offices of the church, if they had it not from that church from which they departed?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Surely they never owned their call from Rome, from whence they had departed, and had manifeſted to be the ſeat of Antichriſt, but withal aſſert, that their call was ſom what extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and ſom what ordinary: God in that time of ſpiritual darkneſs, moved moſt powerfully and vigorouſly on the hearts of the firſt Reſtorers; as <hi>Wickliffe, Huſſe, Luther, &amp;c.</hi> and gave them ſuch a call of abilities and courage, that was not ordinary in that great firſt undertaking, and breaking forth of light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He gave them the ordinary call of their reſpective churches, to be their Paſtors, Teachers, &amp;c. So being both abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated, and called of God and man, they had a true and juſtifiable call to the Miniſtery of Chriſt. If any one ſay, the Miniſterial office muſt precede in order before the Being of the church; I grant, that the church cannot be called or gathered without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent officer, for, <hi>How ſhall they hear without a Preacher?</hi> Or, <hi>how ſhall they preach, unleſs they be ſent:</hi> But withal, rejoyn and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53073:76"/>
ſuper-add, that in the firſt conſtitution of churches, extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calls did ſupply all wants otherwiſe; ſo I am of opinion, it may be granted that in ſo miſerable collapſed church eſtate, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian darkneſs in the times of the firſt Reformation was, God did ſupply (not with ordinary gifts only) thoſe that he employed in that work of the firſt Reformation, and in abſence of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary call, God gave them an additament of parts and gifts, not ordinary, which was to be obſerved in all their conſtant courſe and Miniſtery, carried on with a Spirit of extraordinary courage and abilities: Witneſs that ſaying of <hi>Luther,</hi> when he was adviſed by ſome of his friends, in reſpect of danger, that he ſhould abſtain from a Diet, wherein he promiſed to give his adverſaries a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; he anſwered, if there were as many divels at the Diet, as there were tyles in the City, he would not fear them, but would among them. But in rightly conſtituted churches, the ordinary call is not to be neglected, but to be attended to, as a poſitive Law of God indiſpenſable, and not in the leaſt to be ſlighted; but where God hath diſpenſed, by interpoſing an intervening neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and clear obſtacle thereunto, and therein God loves obedience better then ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That the firſt Miniſterial Reformers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver maintained a perſonal ſucceſſion of Miniſtery and Officers, from the Apoſtles lineally, through the loyns of Antichriſt, but only a ſucceſſion of doctrine, which in all ages was by the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church maintained and aſſerted, ſomtimes with more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and viſibility then other; for if we ſhould grant a perſonal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of officers and Miniſtery from the Apoſtles days, we muſt needs alſo grant a perpetual and neceſſary viſibility of a church, and conſequentially, a truth of Miniſtery, and Ordinances of Chriſt, in the Antichriſtian ſtate; and how a true chriſtian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Ordinances can be found in that Antichriſtian ſtate, in that man of ſin, that miſtery of iniquity, that whore of Babylon, as I formerly ſaid, I know not; or how the ſame ſtate can be both meerly antichriſtian and chriſtian; a Whore of Babylon, and a Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt; a Miniſtery of God, and a myſterie of iniquity; a Temple of God, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Idols; I leave it to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious to conſider.</p>
                  <p>In the next place in the affirmative, I hold, That a true and Juſtifiable call, reſpecting the eſſence thereof, may be received in any the churches of Chriſt, holding the foundation aright, of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though otherwiſe differing among themſelves in many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial points, yet, <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> it may more comfortably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from one church then another, as formerly was evinced; the more pure, ſpiritual, and ſound the churches are, the more ſound, ſpiritual, and edifying their Miniſterial functions are, the more looſe, unſound, and corrupted the churches are, the more corrupt and looſe their Miniſterial call will be: Therefore the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53073:77"/>
churches, and ſoundeſt in the faith, are in the firſt place, for miſſions, Miniſterial calls and offices, to be ſought and repaired unto.</p>
                  <p>But if any one ſhould ask me, what I thought then of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miniſtery of England, as now conſtituted, who, as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ordain one another to their Miniſterial offices, who were firſt ordained themſelves by the late Biſhops, and ſo holding their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from them, as from true Presbyters.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, and I think it not meet, but contrary to the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel, to cloud my judgement in any thing; If the Engliſh Presbyterie (as the Helvetian and Genevan hath done to their perpetual glory) had declared to the world, that the Romiſh church was the antichriſtian whore, and ſo publiquely renounced all miniſterial calls, as derived from her, then I grant ſuch mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Presbyters to be true Miniſters and Presbyters, as unto the eſſence and being thereof (though collating of offices, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as officers or Presbyters, without the juſt aſſent, and aſſiſtance of their churches, is not ſo juſtifiable, as hereafter I may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to evince) but if they maintained their calls from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to be good, as by ſucceſſion of Presbyters, they have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nullified and undone their caſe, and their call too, in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and my reaſon is, for what was not good and juſtifiable in the fountain and firſt origen, cannot be made juſtifiable by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in the ſtreams and branches: a polluted fountain cannot ſend forth ſweet wholſome ſtreams; <hi>cauſa cauſae, cauſa cauſati.</hi> If that Epiſcopacy was antichriſtian, as moſt of them grant, (though both name and office are warrantable in a Goſpel regulated ſenſe) from whom they had their firſt miſſion and calls, how then comes their calls more warrantable then that of their firſt Authors and Founders? If Biſhops in their miniſtery were orthodox and ſound, how came they to ſupplant them, and pull them down? Chriſt's miniſtery is not for the work of deſolating and dethroning Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the ſame holy function, but rather for conſolidating and confirming; therefore ſurely there was ſomwhat amiſs, all was not right, or elſe they might have ſtood to this day. Witneſs the National Covenant againſt Antichriſtian Prelacy, &amp;c. But the truth is, Epiſcopacy, as it was then conſtituted in England, was of the off ſpring and brood of Babylon; they always held their call good, as miniſterial Biſhops, having their perſonal calls from ſuch ſucceſſively, as firſt received it from the church of Rome, and ſo could never be made good or juſtifiable in the ſucceſſion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it ſuffice, as ſome ſay, to ſalve it, that Chriſt had always a church of inviſible Saints under antichriſt, becauſe they muſt prove themſelves then to ſucceed that very church, or thoſe very inviſible Saints; and not only that, but that thoſe very Saints were miniſterial officers or Presbyters, or elſe all will be in vain, according to their own conceſſions; for men may be Saints, but not miniſterially Saints ſent, or Presbyters, who according to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53073:77"/>
them, hath the alone power of ordination, and therefore in want of ſuch true miniſterial Presbyters in the ſucceſſion of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, muſt either unavoidably acknowledge, according to their own principles, their miniſterial offices void and null, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe plainly concede, that they have it derivatively from the church of Rome: and what a ſorry call that is, (if at leaſt ſo to be called) I have formerly evinced. And it is a maxime in Law, that <hi>quod initio vitioſum est, non poreſt tractu temporis convaleſcere.</hi> See more hereon, <hi>Du Pleſſis</hi> Treat. <hi>Of the Church,</hi> p. 3624. and Biſhop <hi>Jewel Defen.

The church of Epheſus had ſuffered much from ſuch falſe Teachers, for Chriſt's ſake, and his truth. The falſe Prophets of old were alwaies againſt the true ones, and cauſed them often to be ſmitten and afflicted; as <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> was jeared by <hi>Zedekiah, Which way went the Spirit from me to thee?</hi> 1 Kings 22. 2, 4. and that not all, but was ſmitten diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on the check alſo: <hi>Shemaiah</hi> ſtirred up the authority againſt <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Lord's Prophet, and would have caſt him in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29.24. Yea ſaith <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 22.25. There is a conſpiracy of her Prophets in the midſt thereof; not only like Foxes, but even like Lions, ravening the prey. Theſe falſe Teachers have been always very pernicious to Gods true church: What great perſecuters <hi>Arrius</hi> and his followers were to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and the Orthodox? They were the Prieſts and falſe Prophets of old, that ſhed the blood of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, though not by their own hands, yet by incenſing the authority to do it: How willingly would <hi>Pilate</hi> releaſe Chriſt, if it were not for the out-cry of the Prieſts and their followers: falſe prophets ſtill exclaim and faſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Magiſtrate, and tells them, that they ſhall do God good ſervice in ſacrificing the Saints, which they term heretiques, or ſchiſmatiques, and troublers of their peace and union; but when you meet ſuch a fiery perſecuting ſpirit in any that pretend to Chriſt, judge of it whence it is by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12, 13.

                     <hi>Quere</hi> But it may here be queried; for what things ought we to ſuffer with patience and conſtancy, and not to faint under the burden thereof?</p>
                  <p>I have partly formerly anſwered this queſtion in the ninth verſe of the firſt chapter: I ſhall here add one word more, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the judgment, and keeping the conſcience undefiled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Firſt, Know that every ſoul is ſtrictly obliged to obſerve all the Laws of God, whether Moral, Natural, or Poſitive, and to undergo all ſufferings whatſoever, rather then to diſhonour God by the breach of the former, or neglect his worſhip by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the latter: We are not only bound, under perſecutors to keep the conſcience undefiled, in not committing groſs ſins, as Idolatry, &amp;c. but alſo we are obliged to perform all our poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive chriſtian duties, though we ſuffer for it: as we find that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> gave a teſtimony in this caſe, though to the hazard of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to extremity, and would not forbear his three times a day ſolemn prayers, and that upon his knees in his chamber, and his windows open towards Jeruſalem; though he knew his enemies might by that means ſurprize and accuſe him, and cauſe him to be caſt into the Den of Lions; yet did he hold himſelf bound daily to the Law of outward Worſhip, though the looking to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was but a ceremony ordained by God upon <hi>Solomon</hi>'s prayer, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.9. Alſo the Macchabean Worthies did not think that perſecution did, or could diſcharge them from the ſtrict obſerving even of the Ceremonial Law, of not eating Swines fleſh, but for it endured all extremity of torments, as the Story relates; and for it are juſtly ranked among the Worthies of the old Teſtament, who lived and died in faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. So jealous is God not only for the preſervation of his Moral Laws, but even of thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and Ritual Laws; that after he hath diſcovered his Will about them, and commands them, they forthwith become mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poſitive Laws, and obligent, until their repeals from the ſame authority are manifeſted and cleared. Therefore by this Judge, what a lax and looſe Religion does <hi>Hobbs</hi> his <hi>Leviathan</hi> preſcribe unto us, to ſubmit to any Religion that the chief or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Magiſtrate ſhall dictate to us; and that it is not chriſtians duty to ſuffer for any Article, but for that, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſias; ſo ſubjecting almoſt the whole will of God in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and poſitives, unto the will of man.

follows cloſe in the heels thereof, with ſomwhat to be ſaid againſt her: juſt as it is often ſaid of the good Kings of Iſrael, in the book of Kings, That <hi>they walked and did uprightly in the ſight of God, as</hi> David <hi>the King;</hi> but withal, there is added a <hi>but; But they departed not from the ſins of</hi> Jeroboam, <hi>that made Iſrael to ſin.</hi> Hence by the way Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the pureſt churches, and the beſt chriſtians, are not altogether exempted from ſtains, but have their ſpots and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, as well as reſplendent graces. It was the Spouſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5. where ſhe deſcribes her ſelf, and ſaith, <hi>I am black, but comly (O ye daughters of Jeruſalem) as the Tents of Kedar, as the Curtains of Solomon.</hi> Let us out ſurvey the firſt churches and chriſtians, to elucidate and confirm this truth; and ſeeing they ſtood neereſt the light, even the Sun of Truth, and his Twelve illuſtrious radiating Signs, (his Apoſtles) in my judgement, they are to be reputed the ſoundeſt, and the pureſt; yet ſee whether we read not of their <hi>Maculae,</hi> or ſpots, as well as of their ſhining gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The church of Corinth was a famous church, yet ſhe had her failings, contaminating the holy feaſts, and their Agapees with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, and beſides, the foul errors of falſe Apoſtles, as denying the Reſurrection, &amp;c. The church of Galatia was not much inferiour in her wantonnizing after liveleſs ceremonial fancies, and preſſed them, as neceſſary (with Chriſt) unto ſalvation; and when <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed them herein, for whoſe ſake they once were ready to pull out their eyes to do him good, yet now for croſſing their capricious whimſies, is become their greateſt adverſary. The churches of Epheſus, Pergamus, &amp;c. had their ſeveral encomiums for their graces, yet there were ſome things chargeable on them, for waxing cold in their firſt love, for admitting the Doctrine of Balaam, Nicolaitans, Jezabel, &amp;c. If we deſcend from bodies collective to individual perſons, we ſhall find the ſame lot befal unto all; conſider <hi>Noah, Job, David, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. but I deſire not to rake up the faults of the Saints, which are not left upon record to encourage to ſin, but to be preſidents of the grace of God, and as examples for encouragement unto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</hi>] Some difficulty ſeems in theſe words; whether by firſt love be intended Chriſt whom the church of Epheſus had left? Or, that firſt ardent affection and zeal which ſhe bore to Chriſt at her firſt converſion? The latter Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to me is clear, Becauſe the church of Epheſus had not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn her ſelf from the faith of Chriſt, as is evident by the two precedent verſes; for it was for Chriſt's ſake, and his truth, that ſhe had ſuffered much, both from wicked perſons, and wicked teachers; therefore, as long as her faith was ſound, ſhe could not be ſaid to have left Chriſt, as her firſt Love, and taken a new love, or new object of her faith: But that for which ſhe is charged as faulty, is, that ſhe hath left her firſt love, that is, her firſt zeal, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53073:79"/>
fervent affections, which ſhe bore to Chriſt and his Ordinances at her firſt converſion; and this is plain from the next verſe, where ſhe is commanded to repent, and to do her firſt works. From hence obſerve,</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That it is frequently ſeen, that many true and faithful chriſtians and churches, do much abate and fail in their firſt zeal and love to Chriſt and his ways, in a ſhort progreſs of time after their converſion, or from their firſt entertainment of the Truth. <hi>Paul</hi> did much complain of the church of Galatia in this particular, at their firſt entertainment of the truth, they were ſo full of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and zeal, that they were even ready to pull out their eyes to do <hi>Paul</hi> ſervice, who was their great Apoſtle; yet ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he complains of them, as if they had entertained another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and exclaims; <hi>O fooliſh Galathians! who hath bewitched you?</hi> It ſeems Epheſus was much faulty herein; and ſo were divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the primitive churches; and therefore the Apoſtles were very urgent and preſſing in their preachings, to maintain love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and of the three eminent Goſpel graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity, charity has the precedency, Firſt, in regard it hath a more extenſive object then the other two; faith and hope reſpects only God, and eternal glory as their object, charity hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God for its object, but the Saints alſo. Secondly, it hath the precedency, in that love abideth in glory, when faith and hope ceaſeth: Thirdly, it is as the ſoul and life unto other graces: faith it ſelf is but as a dead carcaſs, unleſs it be enlivened by love.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I could wiſh that this were ſtill a paradox, That the love of chriſtians is waxed cold; for it was once a hard ſaying, to be a chriſtian, and to want love; I have read that ſome chriſtians of the firſt ages after Chriſt were ſo famous amongſt their heathen adverſaries for this grace of love, that they were ready even to die one for another; whereof their very enemies taking notice, with approbation, when they would commend the love of any, they would ſay proverbially, that it was like the love of chriſtians: but now, O chriſtians! <hi>Quantum mut aſt is ab illo!</hi> It was far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with you at your firſt coming to the truth, then it is now; then every one loved one the other for the truths ſake At the firſt breaking out of light in England from under Antichriſtian clouds and darkneſs, every one had his breaſt on fire for the promotion of truth and godlineſs; Presbyterian, Independent, and Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſt, were then all under the notion of Puritans, and Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, zealous for the common cauſe of advancement of Chriſt and his Goſpel: what is the cauſe that ye have now left your firſt love, both towards God, and towards one another? Is God and Truth grown leſs lovely then at firſt? Or were you miſtaken then
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53073:79"/>
in the right objects of your love? I rather fear, of the both, that the God of the world hath blinded you, when ye ſeek to advance every one his particular intereſt by rearing one the other moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably, as bears, not as chriſtians; who are meek, full of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of compaſſion, eaſily to be entreated, &amp;c. <hi>Have ye not one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one Spirit, one Scripture, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hope of Salvation?</hi> and yet look upon one the other, as the Jews did on the Samaritans, and that for ſome ſmall differences in circumſtantials of Religion: It would better beſuit chriſtians to be like the good Samaritan, that will be ready to pour oyl and wine into the wounds of their afflicted brethren, not vinegar and gall, which was the work of thoſe that piercd Chriſt, not of his followers and diſciples.</p>

Where is the love of the Presbyterian to his Geneva mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, as if it had been the very Elixar of all church Diſcipline? Was he not even fire and ſword againſt Epiſcopacy, that ſtood in his way as a bar to the advancement of his Form; and now Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy being down, and the aſpect of authority benigne towards them, yet how remiſs and cold are they in ſetting up their Elders? I believe they fear the <hi>Iure Divine</hi> of it, and therefore will not move a foot farther, without a Soveraign hand for to ſupport it: but all this ſhows they have much abated in their firſt love. Next, What is become of the ardent affections, and frequent private and publique exerciſes and aſſemblings of the Independents? Were they not the only men in the world, in their firſt appearance, that carried the face and judgement of Saints, yet now how remiſs and cold they are grown, all ſee? How formal, or rather carnal, are ſome of them become, that were once as fire in the hearth, and in the ſheaf, ready to warm and enflame all that came by, by their ardent affections and duties? Yea, are not many of them, that would not be ſatisfied otherwiſe, but with hewen ſtones for the building of the Temple, evidentially viſible Saints for the Houſe of the Lord, now content, and ſit down ſatisfied in a parochial congregation of a mixed multitude, the tenth whereof, if ſo much be good wheat amongſt the pile of chaff that anſwereth that part which they have for their maintenance, they may account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And how flat their zeal is for the promotion of the truth, all ſee: yea ſtrange how they are changed from their firſt principles, who at firſt loved one the other as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and for the Truths ſake; yet now who more worldly or haughty then they?

                  <p>The ſtraying prodigal experienced this truth in himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. when he came to himſelf, and conſidered, how that many hired ſervants in his fathers houſe had bread enough, and yet he ſtarving for hunger, it made him to reflect upon that full and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious condition when he was as an obedient ſon with his father, which moved him to ſet on the reſolution to be a Trewant no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but to ariſe, and go unto his Father, and ſay, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee.</hi> If any thing will break the courſe of ſin, and recall the heart unto its firſt love, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the former gracious dealings of God with it, will effect it: It will reaſon thus with it ſelf, was it not better with me when I kept cloſe to God, then now it is ſince I have broken with him?

If the will be not right, as to its objects, as well as the judgement, it will not denominate a true repentant. The church of Epheſus was right, as to her faith, for which ſhe ſuffered in patience, yet her practiſe and affections were not ſtreight, for which ſhe had the check, and commanded to do the firſt works, works of love, works of charity, works of piety, which formerly ſhe had been zealous in: In true repentance there is a <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> and <hi>Terminus ad quem. Turn ye, turn ye every one from the abomination of his ways:</hi> there is the <hi>terminus a quo:</hi> but this is not all, a negative righteouſneſs will not ſerve turn, but there muſt be <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> a poſitive righteouſneſs alſo: There muſt be a doing of the firſt works of holineſs and godlineſs towards God, and of love and righteouſneſs towards all; but more eſpecially towards the houſhold of faith: Theſe are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate ingredients of true and Goſpel repentance. It is a groſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in many, that think that they have believed ſufficiently, and they have repented ſufficiently, when they have altered their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at leaſt, their weather-cock opinion, from one external form unto another; as when an Epiſcopal man is become for a Presbyterie. O moſt kind and benigne Sun-ſhine, quoth he; but when a Presbyterian turns Independent in judgement, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cries out, that heaven is opened unto him; never conſidering that the kingdom of heaven does conſiſt in godlineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but in outward forms of worſhip, which if rightly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſomthing of each might be rightly admitted to make a juſt compoſure. In the next place, ſome think their repentance very ſound, when they have changed one errour for another; when of an Arminian or Pelagian, are become Antinomiſts, rightly ſo termed, denying and oppoſing the morality of the Law, as a rule of duty obliging unto chriſtians: when of an Arrian, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarian, are become Tridheites, or worſhippers of three Gods &amp;c. So corrupt is the heart of man, that will make his own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Idol, and all that looks not that way, nor brings any flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to that ſacrifice (and yet otherwiſe apparently gracious) ſhall neither have the title of a true believer, or a repentant ſoul, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: Therefore with all ſuch I would leave this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,

Another Note from the authority of the perſon, (Chriſt) that gives this <hi>memento,</hi> is, That Chriſt's commands in his Word, ſhould be very powerful and efficacious, to bring us unto repentance. Shall Chriſt be our Anamneſtes, or Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer, and ſet our faults before us, by his Spirit in the Word, and ſhall not our hearts be molten for it? Shall he call from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us in his ever-living word of Propheſie, and ſhall we not intend, or hearken to that heavenly viſion? He gave but one glance on <hi>Peter,</hi> reflecting on his unkindneſs and denial, which cauſed <hi>Peter</hi> to turn aſide, and weep bitterly: And ſhall he not only look upon us with his daylie providential acts of goodneſs and mercy, which leadeth unto repentance, but give us line upon line, and precept upon precept, and yet not return by repentance: It is the ſigne of moſt obdurate hearts, and of ſtiff-necked ſinners.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, We want wills to it, and if Chriſt gave wills as well as commands, we ſhould readily follow him.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, Where Chriſt lays his commands on his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ones, he alſo gives there the firſt grace of his Spirit to enable to obey that command; and we know the Spirit may be oppoſed, and the Spirit may be quenched, and is ſo often by our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and by reaſon of the abundancy of corruptions; ſo that the want of wills to good things, proceed from our own baſe and corrupt wills, not for want of power from Chriſt, who commands us to them; but take notice, though the operations of the Spirit may by the Elect themſelves be oppoſed, darkned, and quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed partially, but not totally and finally, but at laſt will get the victory, in bringing forth the work of God unto perfection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is in vain for perſons in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nregenerate ſtate to complain for want of wills, for before Chriſt moves thereon by his Spirit of grace, they cannot rightly will any good thing or work; but the firſt grace being given to any, and after follows a complaint of want of will to holy performances, it is a good ſigne, that there is a good will unto it, or elſe there would not be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, which is only for a greater meaſure, not for a total want of will unto it.</p>
                  <p>Thirly, and laſtly, Underſtand that Chriſt often exhibits his commands of faith and repentance, even to the reprobate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to manifeſt unto them their duty, the due performance whereof, they have in their original firſt parent loſt and forfeited, and God is not obliged to reſtore it, ſeeing the vindication of Gods juſtice is as dear unto him as his mercy; and therefore when Chriſt in his Miniſtery bids ſuch perſons to believe and repent, they never complain of want of wills unto the work, but rather add ſin unto ſin, in a more obdurate unbelief. But to proceed.</p>

                     <hi>Or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent.]</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid unto

the church of Epheſus, if thou wilt not return unto me, and unto thy firſt love, by this gracious warning I have given thee, be ſure I will come in judgment againſt thee, and that ſhortly; and though my appearance as yet unto thee (whiles there is hopes of thy reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) be in the likeneſs of the Son of man, one of thy own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and compaſſionate towards thee, yet know, if thou wilt not repent, and do thy firſt works of love, zeal, and charity, I ſhall forthwith come in another like reſemblance, having mine eyes as a flame of fire, and a two-edg'd ſword proceeding from my mouth, and deſtroy thee and thy church-ſtate, and that quickly, unleſs thou ſpeedily amend thy faults.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Hence Note, That a ſpeedy repentance is the only means to avert the judgements of God from falling upon a church or people. <hi>Ahab</hi>'s repentance, though it was but hypocritical and unſound, yet ſtayed God in executing his judgements on him. The repentance of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> for their Adultery and Idolatry, ſtayed God's hand againſt them; and many others of the Kings of Iſrael experienced the goodneſs of God in this particular, and by reaſon of their ſincere endeavours of returning unto God, by demoliſhing their abominations and idolatries, God promiſed them he would not bring the evil in their days, which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt his Idolatrous people the Jews, but ſhould be gathered in peace unto their fathers. The Ninivites upon their repentance in ſackcloth and aſhes, on <hi>Jonas</hi> preaching, had a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er date ſet to their political ſtate and City: and this repentance too ought to be ſpeedy; for who knows how long God will ſuffer (though long often he does) before he ſends forth the unevitable decree of execution: As God is merciful, ſlow to anger, ſlow to wrath, yet know, that God is alſo juſt, and that one attribute is as dear unto him as another; the duty we ſee is preſently required, and we know not, though God defers the execution, whether he will give us hearts again unto the work, after we have once ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his gracious calls and invitations thereunto: It was an old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Sero ſapiunt Phryges,</hi> which may be our lot, if we defer too long: and we know that to be true, that <hi>ſera penitentia raro vera:</hi> and conſider how it was too late for Jeruſalem to howl and cry after ſhe had ſlighted the many gracious invitations of our Saviour unto repentance, who would have gathered her, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wing: When <hi>Titus</hi> the Roman General had caſt a Trench againſt her walls, and bolted up her gates by the ſiege of a potent Army, Chriſt tells the church of Epheſus, and the reſt of thoſe Siſter Aſian churches, if they do not repent, he will come quickly in judgements againſt them, as indeed he did in few ages after, by the incurſions of barbarous Nations, and quite remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their churches from amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quere.</hi> But is not this a Legal teaching, to denounce wrath and judgements on non-amendment, or for want of repentance?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Such as object thus, are much miſtaken; for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53073:82"/>
is not ſtrictly a Legal duty, but a duty Evangelical, and of grace: for the Law admits of no repentance: for it ſaith, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, ſhall die:</hi> It is the Goſpel of grace alone, that ſaith <hi>Repent, and live;</hi> that is, Return from thy wicked ways, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt as thy Lord, Saviour, and Teacher, and thou ſhalt be ſaved: The Law is inexorable, and exacts the whole ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the penalty of the breach thereof, which was fully laid on Chriſt, and ſatisfied by him; It is grace alone that accepts the will for the deed, and admits of repentance in the ſinner, whiles the Surety hath compleatly ſatisfied the juſtice and rigour of the offended Law.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What God hath ſanctified, no man ſhould call un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy; for hath not Chriſt commanded this duty of repentance very abundantly in the Goſpel, and very often to be interpreted for faith it ſelf, and ſhall we count it Legal? <hi>Repent, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 2.38. <hi>Repent, or ye ſhall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe periſh, &amp;c.</hi> But I confeſs there is no little difference between Repentance under the Goſpel adminiſtration, and the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtration; under the one, the doctrine thereof is more clearly taught, upon more evident terms of grace: In the other, more darker, and on more ſenſitive and carnal grounds. As Chriſt under the Law was vailed under clouds, and typical ordinances, but under the Goſpel, more clearly preached unto all; ſo his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of grace, faith, and repentance, were not by far ſo radiant before the days of his manifeſtation in the fleſh, as after; ſo the difference lies in the degrees of clearneſs, not of the verity and truth of the doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quere</hi> 2. But again ſome may query, Is not this to joyn Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Chriſt in ſome cauſality unto ſalvation, and to ſet them both, as it were, in a joynt commiſſion, though ſomwhat ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately unto that great end?</p>
                  <p>Indeed this is a queſtion worthy the clearing, which many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful ignorantly handle, not knowing how to divide the Word of God aright, do miſerably ſtumble in it. Underſtand, for clearing of this in the order of cauſes, God's free love is the firſt moving and predeterminating cauſe unto life and ſalvation, Chriſt next is the alone procuring and meritorious cauſe; and as Chriſt hath purchaſed the Elect unto himſelf by his death and merit; ſo as a King, or a Soveraigne Legiſlator, he ſets up a Royal Law for his Redeemed people to walk by; to wit, that of Repentance towards God, and Faith unto Jeſus Chriſt. Now he ſets not Faith nor Repentance in any cauſality with himſelf in this great work of life and ſalvation, this is only but a principal part of his revealed Will and Law, that he will have his redeemed ones to walk in; he doth not require thoſe graces in them, as co-operating, or efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes unto life or juſtification, nor as conditions, properly ſo called, for on the performance of every condition, by vertue of compact, it hath a legal influence, merit, and cauſality unto the production
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53073:82"/>
of its end: Neither indeed is there any ſuch compact in the Word ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that on the performance of any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be they never ſo Evangelical, as Faith, Repentance, &amp;c. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or life, was promiſed thereupon, only the condition of the old covenant between God and man, was death upon diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and life upon obedience: Man having forfeited the one by his diſobedience, Chriſt ſteps in as the Mediator of a better and ſurer covenant, and makes his ſoul an offering unto death, which was the full performance of the penal condition due unto the ſinner, and ſo abſolutely purchaſed a bleſſed ſeed unto himſelf, and on ſuch ſtable conditions performed altogether by himſelf, that they cannot poſſibly forfeit their inheritance, being in ſo ſure a hand, and are ſtill heirs, though whiles under years they differ not from ſervants; that is, whiles under ſin, and unregeneracy, are ſtill in bondage, until faith come to diſcover their heirſhip, and intereſt unto the purchaſed poſſeſſion; and in the mean time, by evil works, they are as enemies, ſtrangers, and aliens to God, and the commonweal of Iſrael, according to the old Legal diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have notwithſtanding <hi>Jus ad Rem,</hi> though not <hi>Jus in Re.</hi>

                  <p>And though I deny faith or repentance to be conditions (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called) in the covenant to life or juſtification, yet I ſay, they are required in the ſame new Law, Covenant, or Teſtament, as conditions, improperly ſo called, or as conditions in order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding one the other, and as benefits of the ſame covenant: But ſeeing the word condition is of late glown ſo rampant, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much perfumed with the Spiceries of Rome, I ſhall willingly let it lie, as that other term of merit, which in their firſt births were more innocent, and inoffenſive, and ſhall rather call them as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and qualities required in the new covenant by Chriſt, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in all his redeemed ones to life and ſalvation: And when I ſay they are duties neceſſary, I would be underſtood, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, but <hi>virtate precepti,</hi> and <hi>virtute medii,</hi> unto all ſuch as are capable of their duties, but not unto Infants or Idiots, that want the uſe of reaſon; for to believe and repent, are acts of the will and underſtanding, which Infants or Idiots are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; and therefore we exempt them from ſalvation, dying ſo, if the condition of faith was abſolute and peremptory, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> once dreamed, and therefore was called <hi>durus pater Infantum:</hi> and all others muſt conclude the like harſh judgement on them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that hold actual faith and repentance as abſolute neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions unto juſtification and life.</p>
                  <p>But again, If it were true what the Arminian ſays, That none are ſaved but on the condition of the <hi>To credere,</hi> or act of faith, and none damned but for unbelief; then I re-aſſume, that ſome perſons according to this, are neither damned nor ſaved; for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying ſuch, as aforeſaid, cannot have (by reaſon of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity) the act of faith nor unbelief, which is a privation by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53073:83"/>
or reſiſtance of the truth made manifeſt: Indeed ſuch abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities do they incur, that aſſert ſuch abſolute conditions in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace to be done on man's part; yet I ſay, they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and peremptory on Chriſt's part to be performed, and he having fully finiſhed all the conditions for his elect ones by his death (though ſome of them dying Infants) yet are ſaved by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that everlaſting covenant made with Chriſt, in, for, and on the behalf of all his choſen ones, of whom he will not loſe one which the Father hath given him.</p>
                  <p>From this precedent diſcourſe you may plainly conclude, that though I grant repentance a neceſſary Goſpel duty, and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good ends it is ordained ſo, yet do not in the leaſt place it in any ſubordinate cauſality, joyntly with Chriſt, in the work of our ſalvation, but only as our duty, thorowfare, or way thereunto, commanded and inſtituted by Chriſt, as part of his new Law, that he himſelf might have the pre-eminence in all things, and the name and glory alone of our ſalvation. And this hereon ſhall ſuffice. See more hereon v. 23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. Another Note hence is, That the doctrine of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and threats, is a very uſeful Goſpel doctrine.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt hath paſſed with his doctrine of grace, and offers a reconcilement freely, if the ſinner will but turn from his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and repent, and yet the ſinner will refuſe his gracious terms, he hath another burden to tell him, that after he hath refuſed ſo great ſalvation, he can caſt both ſoul and body into hell fire: the moſt obdurate and incorrigible child muſt have the ſharpeſt rod; a ſmile, or a love-token will work upon the ingenious, but ſaith <hi>Solomon, a rod is for the back of a fool.</hi> Neither is judgement a ſtrange work unto Chriſt; for as he is related unto his church, as a Saviour, and a Father, reſpecting his grace and loving kindneſs, ſo he is as well a Judge, and a Legiſlator, and ſo may juſtly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe his church, as contemners and tranſgreſſors of his Royal Law. If he calls us to repent, which is part of his new covenant Law, as he did the church of Epheſus, and yet go on obſtinately in ſin, juſtly may he remove his candleſtick from amongſt us: If his Lamb-like quality of mercy and grace will not invite us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he can roat as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, which will cauſe us to call upon the mountains to fall upon us, and to hide us from the preſence of the Lamb: wherefore they are much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that would ſhut out as uſeleſs, the doctrine of threats and judgements from the Goſpel, which are to be preached ſoberly, and conditional, not peremptory and abſolute; for if there were not a curb, and fear of loſs and puniſhment, the wanton ſtraying ſoul would hardly be reclaimed, though the more tender hearted the apprehenſion of grace and love might reclaim and mollifie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv</hi> 3. Another Obſervation is, To take off God's candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, or to unchurch a Nation or people, is the moſt grievous of all God's judgements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:53073:83"/>Chriſt could not afflict the church of Epheſus with a greater loſs, then to remove his church from among them: for hereby,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Privatively, His glory and ſpecial preſence of grace and favour is withdrawn.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The guidance, light, and comfort of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is departed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, His Ordinances are all defiled and vaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, His ſpecial protection is withdrawn alſo.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, Inſtead of his gracious preſence, they have his preſence in wrath, judgements, and fiery indignations; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of his Spirit of light and comfort, they have the diſmal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of darkneſs, errour, and deſpair; inſtead of Chriſt's holy Ordinances, they have the Divel's ſacrifices; and inſtead of God's ſpecial protection over them, they are carried captives by Satan to all foul and unclean luſts whatſoever. This is the moſt ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when God does unchurch a people for their ſins: witneſs the habitation of theſe ſeven Aſian churches, wherein the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan in Mahumatiſm and Heatheniſm is ſet up in the room of Chriſt's holy Doctrine and Ordinances, and all for their impenitency and obſtinacy in their loud crying abominations: and therefore I cannot too often recognize this verſe to backſlidden ſouls, <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt works; or elſe I will come againſt thee ſhortly, and will remove thy Candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt goes on, and tells the church of Epheſus, that though ſhe was juſtly faulty for her defection in her firſt love, yet ſhe had this commendable point in her to be added unto her other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable graces, That ſhe abhorred the abominations of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans both in judgment and practiſe, which alſo was moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and abominable unto Chriſt himſelf. Now the Sect of the Nicolaitans, as all Eccleſiaſtique hiſtory teſtifies, took the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from <hi>Nicholas,</hi> a Deacon of Antioch; but whether he was their leader himſelf, or whether they falſly pretended him the firſt founder of their hereſie, is diſputable: Indeed <hi>Ireneus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> are of opinion, that he himſelf was their leader; yet <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius. lib.</hi> 3. do ſay, That the Nicolaitans had falſly pretended the name of <hi>Nicholas</hi> to their hereſie, as M. <hi>Baxter</hi> aſſerts in his book of Infidelity, p. 132. However, we ſee their hereſies were abominable; for Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them: and their heretical practiſes and opinions conſiſted (as Antiquity teſtifies) under the name of chriſtians, to hold and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all manner of corporal obſcenities and adulteries lawful, and all manner of ſpiritual fornication and idolatries alſo; and which they grounded on this wicked principle, That there was no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53073:84"/>
in good or evil, but only in opinion; and therefore took li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to all ſorts of wickedneſſes. And that theſe were chief heads of their hereſies, is ſomwhat evident from verſe 14, <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. of this chapter, where the doctrine of Balaam and Nicolaitans are joyned and compared. Now we know, that <hi>Balaam</hi>'s wicked doctrine was, <hi>To lay a stumbling block before the children of Iſrael,</hi> to entice them to offend God both in corporal and ſpiritual whoredom, in the buſineſs of Baal Peor, that ſo by offending him, they might periſh. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. compared to 31.16. The Nicolaitans were this falſe Prophet's true diſciples, and were true branches of the Gnoſticks of old, who pretended ſtrange and unknown high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and diſcoveries of light, which plain and orthodox chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians never heard of; as many of the ſame ſpirit now a days pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, on purpoſe to amuſe the ſimple, and to draw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſnare of Satan: and how well theſe filthy dreamers amongſt us, do correſpond with their elder Brethren, the Nicholaitans, compare the hereſies and blaſphemies of ſome of theſe times, with that deſcription of the Nicholaitans, made by M. <hi>Baxter</hi> out of hiſtorical Antiquity, page 129. of his ſaid book of Infidelity: ſpeaking of the Nicholaitans, whoſe inhumane filthineſs (ſaith he) was ſuch, and their diveliſh conceits ſo many and vile, that I will forbear to mention them; only this, They made themſelves like Chriſt, and ſome of them to be equal to him, and ſome the ſame with him: That good and evil differed not in deed, but in mens opinions; they worſhipped Images, they lived in ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ways in luſt and filthineſs, as is not to be named: <hi>Epiphanius</hi> himſelf unhappily fell in amongſt them, and knew their ways from their own mouths and actions, but happily eſcaped when they would have drawn him to their luſts; They have multitudes of amazing words and notions, like our Behmeniſts, that would bring a man into a ſuſpition of witchcraft to read them: They uſed witchcrafts, and ſeveral ſorts of inchantments, and kept divels in familiarity with them, that by their means they might encreaſe their knowledge and power, Thus far M. <hi>Baxter.</hi> And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes afterward, that it is not one, nor two, but all church hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe times, that makes mention of them, do ſay the ſame things; and if they will read <hi>Epiphanius</hi> himſelf, who once fell in amongſt them, they will ſee much more. Having thus far deſcribed the Nicholaitans, and their hereſies, in the next place take this Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the more pure, ſound, and undefiled the church is, the divel is moſt ſolicitous to raiſe hereſies and ſchiſms in it.</p>
                  <p>How buſie the divel was in thoſe Aſian churches in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, to bring in the foul hereſies of the Nicolaitans, the doctrines of <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> if poſſibly he could, ſo to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice them to ſin againſt their God, that he might have his purpoſe on them; but when the church became more corrupted, tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and antichriſtianized, under the headſhip of the Biſhop of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53073:84"/>
Rome, their hereſies were leſs, and their ſchiſmes fewer, then in the primitive purer times; for Satan would rather hereticate and poyſon the whole, then a part; and indeed the divel has his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne accompliſhed, when he ſees a church ruſhing onward to their own deſtruction, by the multitude of their corruptions; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch, he hath no need to lay any of his ſtratagems of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and ſchiſms, but only to let them in peace and ſecurity, and they will haſten on faſt enough unto their own deſtruction: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hence, unto me it is a good argument, that we have true and faithful churches of Chriſt amongſt us, and that the true doctrine of the Goſpel is ſincerely preached and taught amongſt our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or elſe Satan (the envious one) would not be ſo ready to ſow alſo his tares of hereſies and errour, as he does at preſent amongſt us, to overthrow (if he may) our hopes and harveſt. It ſeems to me but a ſad ſaying, when ſome Miniſters affirm, they give thanks to God that their churches are not troubled with the hereſies of the times: though I confeſs hereſies are great evils, and to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently deprecated from all Chriſt's flocks; yet when they ſay they are all at peace, it is much to be feared, that there is another ſtrong man keeping the houſe beſides Chriſt; for, be ſure when Chriſt comes to bruiſe Satan's head, he will bite Chriſt's heel; and no ſooner is the man-child Chriſt born in the ſouls of his faithful ones, but the Dragon will preſently ſend forth floods of water of hereſies, errours, and perſecutions, if poſſibly, to deſtroy both it and them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. and this proceeds from that everlaſting enmity ſet between the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, even from the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and will continue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he be bound up in everlaſting chains of darkneſs: and therefore the purer the church is, the buſier will Satan be to undermine them if he may.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. Another Note is, That all hereſie is defiling and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable. Chriſt hates it, and his church hates it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely it hath ſome poyſonous and peſtilential quality in it; ſomtimes it amounts ſo far, as to defile both judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe joyntly, as it did in the Sect of the Nicholaitans: And this it moſt frequently does, unleſs in ſuch a time, when the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of an Angel of light will ſeem better with Satans deſigns: for if the Theoretique part of the underſtanding be not ſound, the practique can hardly be ſtreight; where the light of the eye is darkned, our feet will ſoon ſtumble: and the will and judgement are ſo linked together, that ſome make the will to be the laſt act of the underſtanding, or the practique part of the judgement: ſo nearly they are related into oneneſs, that the contagion of the one, will be the defilement of the other.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſecondly, Satan is ſo ſerpentine and crafty, that often he can reſtrain the will, and put on the forms of an Angel of light, and ſet on a ſtricter garb of holineſs and mortification then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, even unto an Erenetique monaſtical converſation, denying
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53073:85"/>
the lawful comforts of humane life and ſociety, that he may make the greater impreſſion to deceive thereby, as he does in ſome of the crafty deceiving heretiques of theſe days: Therefore it is not only the duty of all Chriſt's faithful ones, but their honour, and glory, and their crown, to abominate and hate all ſuch deeds and myſteries of Satan, even as they are abominated and hated by Chriſt himſelf.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>What is meant by the Spirit that ſpeaks unto the churches, is to be enquired into.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be underſtood, neither Angel, nor the holy Spirit, perſonally conſidered; for in the next immediate verſe, the ſame Spirit is called the firſt and the laſt, which was dead, and is alive.

Review v. 13. of the firſt chapter, more fully to this purpoſe. And here he is called the Spirit, to denote</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:53073:85"/>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That Chriſt is one and the ſame, not only in proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and qualities with the holy Spirit, but in eſſence alſo.</p>
                  <p>He hath the incommunicable properties of the Father in the words in the next verſe, and precedent chapter, v. 4, 8, <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>who is the firſt and the laſt:</hi> In verſ. 18. of this chapter, he is called, <hi>The Son of God;</hi> and in this verſe, he is called, <hi>The Spirit:</hi> all making up this harmonious concluſion and truth, that Chriſt is one and the ſame, everlaſting Father, Son, and Spirit, our God bleſſed for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Another Note from theſe words are, That every wiſe and judicious chriſtian, ought to be very intent and enquiring into the mind of God, in and about all his providential dealings and diſcoveries towards his churches abroad in the world.</p>
                  <p>What God ſpeaks unto his churches, is not of a private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but of a publique concernment unto all others. If God have dealt in judgement and righteouſneſs with thoſe Aſiatique churches, and for their abounding iniquities unrepented of, hath anathematized, and utterly unchurched them all; think not that we ſhall go free, if we be found in the ſame tranſgreſſions with them. There were other churches too, as well as theſe, once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their faith and piety, now become the Dens of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and habitation of all unclean ſpirits: Therefore to avoid the ſtroke of divine judgement by a timely repentance, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveful and neceſſary it is for him that hath an ear, to hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the churches: For be ſure, if we run the ſame courſe of ſin with them, we ſhall drink the ſame cup of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with them alſo; if we continue obſtinate, and repent not: for God is the ſame immutable Being, juſt, and righteous, and a hater of all iniquity, today, and for ever.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>to him that overcometh,</hi> that is, holds out againſt the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual aſſaults of Satan, and ſo overcome his temptations, <hi>will I give</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to eat of the Tree of life, which is in the midſt of the Paradice of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we have the tryumphant Chriſtian Conqueror deſcribed, together with his Crown, and Reward: <hi>To him that overcometh,</hi> that is, the Conqueror: The reward is, <hi>To eat of the Tree of life in the Paradice of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it ſhould be asked, wherein ſhould a chriſtian comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant overcome, to denominate him a true conqueror, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come indeed?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, As God hath furniſhed us with variety of ſpiritual weapons and armory from himſelf, which are mighty through God to pull down the ſtrong Holds of Satan; ſo we have divers and various ſtratagems, and wyles of his, to meet with in our chriſtian warfare here beneath: we have not only to fight with our corruptions within, but we muſt meet with divers aſſaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan alſo from without; enticements and allurements to falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Worſhips: and if we comply not, we may be ſure to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53073:86"/>
meet his buffettings from without, in revilings, reproaches, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp;c. and often, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, fight with unreaſonable and beſtial men, as he did after the manner of Beaſts at Epheſus. So that he that overcometh, to have right to the Tree of life, muſt go farther then overcome the aſſaults and temptations of Satan, as unto the breach of moral duties; but to denominate him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Conquerour, he ought to have a ſpecial eye and regard unto Satan's more ſpiritual and refined deſigns and aſſaults, which lies as it were, againſt the very life of a chriſtian, which he uſhers in by falſe doctrines, and abominable hereſies; which he lays as a ſtumbling block in the ways of God's children; as wicked <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> did ſet a ſnare of Idolatry and Adultery, to make the children of Iſrael fall, that God might be wroth againſt them, and ſo judge them in his diſpleaſure: So Satan ſets up his ſtandard under the hereſies of the Nicolaitans, anti-Trinitarians, anti-Scripturiſts, idolatrizing Antichriſtians, &amp;c. that if poſſibly he can draw the faithful ones of Chriſt to comply with them, and to receive their marks in their hands and foreheads, then he hath the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his deſigne; for, be ſure deſtruction followeth ſpeedily, as the conſequence of ſuch doctrines: So that he that overcometh the aſſaults of Satan, not only reſpecting life, but in doctrine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, is a compleat chriſtian, and conquerour, and ſhall <hi>eat of the Tree of life, in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> Hence ariſeth a Note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> To overcome, is the Chriſtians crown. Or otherwiſe, Perſeverance is a chriſtians great duty. It is not him that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun well, that will obtain the Palm, but holds out his courſe in faithfulneſs: <hi>Vincenti dabitur.</hi> Many have begun in the Spirit, and ended in the fleſh, and ſo loſt their reward. In a Race, he that leaves off at the firſt ſtage, have no hopes to obtain the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: But that Traveller, or way faring man, that endures patiently the hardſhips of a long journey, with all the dangers, difficulties, and extremities, that ways, weather, and other accidents may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, will at laſt doubtleſs attain to his much complacent place and period, whiles the lazie one is deterr'd with the difficulty; and if not in the firſt days journey, yet in the mid-way, is reſty and tyred. It is not ſufficient for us to endure and repulſe a flaſh or two of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans aſſaults, who is as a roaring Lion, night and day going about, ſeeking whom he may devour. As he is reſtleſs in his temptations, ſo we muſt be reſtleſs in our defenſive Guards and Repulſes; our life is a conſtant warfare, and one errour committed in warfare, is remedileſs, and irrecoverable: And though I am far from aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting with the Novatians, That the errours or ſlips of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are irreparable; and though the errours of humane wars ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no repentance, yet the errours of our chriſtian warfare may be reinforced, and redeemed, by a returning unto a more ſtrict and diligent watch upon our hearts and judgements; yet notwithſtanding this, we may loſe much of our comfort in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53073:86"/>
way, and be accounted but as daſtard ſouldiers by our Captain General, in that we have not kept cloſe unto our Colours, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and conſtant in all extremities, in oppoſing the aſſaults and inrodes of the adverſaries; for to that very end, Chriſt, our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain, hath ſet weapons into our hands, which are ſpiritual, and mighty, to oppoſe and overcome all the aſſaults, ſtratagems, and underminings of Satan: Beſides, he hath laid it on us as our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Strive to enter into the ſtrait gate.</hi> And, <hi>The Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffers violence; and</hi> 'tis <hi>the violent</hi> (not the lazie dormant one) <hi>takes it</hi> by <hi>force:</hi> So in this place, <hi>To him that overcometh, to him is given to eat of the Tree of life,</hi> (as his crown and reward) <hi>which is in the midſt of the Paradice of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.2. There is deſcribed, as an additament of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the New Jeruſalem, that new heavenly City or church eſtate, that came down from God, That in the midſt of the ſtreet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of either ſide of the River, there was the Tree of life, which had twelve manner of fruits, and yeilded her fruit every moneth, and the leaves of the Tree were for the healing of the Nations. Thoſe that overcome the ſpiritual aſſaults of Satan, are promiſed to eat of this Tree, which is placed in this Paradice of God. As Paradice was the bleſſed habitation of Adam in his innocent and ſinleſs condition; ſo it is put typically and figuratively both, for that bleſſed eſtate that the Saints enjoy now in heaven. <hi>This day</hi> (ſaith Chriſt unto the penitent Thief) <hi>thou ſhalt be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</hi> Luke 23.43. that is, thou ſhalt be in a bleſſed ſtate and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was rapt up in ſpirit into the third heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. he ſays how that he was caught up into Paradice, that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an incomparable glory. So that Paradice may very fitly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and repreſent figuratively unto us any ſtate of glory, either in the ſupernal heavens, or that that is reſerved for all God's faithful ones, after the re-union and reſurrection of their ſouls and bodies at the laſt day: for God does make things known unto us by ſuch things as we partly already know and underſtand. Now we know Paradice was preſented unto <hi>Adam</hi> full of all delicacy and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the heart of man or his curioſity could wiſh for, and how it was repleniſhed with all goodly fruits, not only pleaſant to the eye, but very ſavoury unto the taſte alſo; by ſenſible things God makes known his hidden myſteries, and ſpiritual delicacy, as unto the children of men: But here lies the difference between the firſt and ſecond Paradice; The firſt Paradice had not only the Tree of life in it, as a reward, and a confirming Sacrament of <hi>Adam</hi>'s eternal felicity, if he had continued obedient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, but it had alſo the Tree of knowledge of good and evil; a Tree, that when he ſhould taſte thereof, and make a breach of his obedience towards his God and his Creator, he ſhould ſadly experience, for himſelf and whole poſterity, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of the fruits thereof; and ſo ſhould come to know, by the ſad event, what was good, and what was evil; how he had wronged
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53073:87"/>
by diſobedience, the chiefeſt good; and as his due reward and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is become liable and obnoxious to mortality, death, and all miſeries that an infinite divine Juſtice can inflict upon him for his diſobedience. Now in this ſecond or laſt Paradice, there is no fear of eating the bitter fruits of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil; for there is no ſuch Tree therein; this laſt is guarded with a ſurer Angel then that that guarded with a flaming ſword at the entrance of the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> The Lamb (in this laſt) is the light and the glory thereof: The firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the poſſeſſor of the firſt Paradice, was of the earth, earthly; but the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> is the poſſeſſor of this, whoſe Throne is in the midſt thereof, and is of heaven, heavenly; Here are no conditions of life and death put upon eating, or not eating; here is only the Tree of life, which is prepared for the faithful conquerour in Chriſt's name, for the confirmation of their eternal happineſs.</p>
                  <p>But it may be queried, what is meant by this Tree of life?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Some of the Ancients, as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others, makes it to be Chriſt, whoſe leaves, that is (ſay they) his merits, is for the healing of the Nations. But ſaving due reverence to antiquity, I rather adhere to thoſe that underſtand it a true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tree of life, as that in the garden of Eden was, for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For Chriſt being perſonally in this heavenly city, or new Jeruſalem; for where ſhould he be but with his Spouſe, the Bride, the Lamb's wife, at that great and ſolemn day of tryumph? And it is ſaid, <hi>That the Lamb is the Temple, and the light of this City,</hi> cap. 21, 22, 23. and therefore evidently convincing, that he is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally abſent from her; and being with her, and preſent, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee how congruous to reaſon it is to ſay or aſſert, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints ſhall eat of that Tree of Chriſt Sacramentally: For when we have the enjoyment of viſion, faith ceaſeth; nor is then any need of ſigns, figures, or Sacraments (the only way that we can eat Chriſt ſpiritually and myſtically) in this heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; for being himſelf then and there preſent with his Saints, that Scripture will be fulfilled, whoſe authority is yet of force, and not at all as yet elapſed (as ſome would have it) to wit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>And lo, I am with you unto the end of the world,</hi> or, of this generation: that is, Chriſt promiſes his preſence of grace, efficacy, comfort, and ſupport, unto the faithful diſpenſing of his Ordinances of the Word and Sacraments unto the end of this world, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſeveral ſeries or courſes of generations that ſhall ſucceed one the other, until the day Star ſhall ariſe, and radiate with a more incomparable glory, and ſet a period to all thoſe preſent Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we now enjoy, which are fitted to our preſent weakneſs and capacities, and reſtore us into the liberty of the Sons of God, and give us Ordinances of a more ſpiritual and higher key, fit for that new and glorious City, the Bride, the Lamb's wife, that comes down from heaven. And why may I not think that in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradice, this Eden of God and Chriſt, this New Jeruſalem,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53073:87"/>
or New Heavens, and New Earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs, according to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. ſhall have the Tree of life placed by God in the midſt thereof, whoſe fruits ſhall ſhine as Sacraments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation unto the bleſſed Saints, of the continuation of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtate and bleſſedneſs for ever; ſo that whether Chriſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be this Tree of life, or whether God ſhall ſet up in his cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Paradice a real Tree of life, as formerly he did to <hi>Adam</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, yet both and either do evince this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That God hath ſecured the everlaſting bleſſed eſtate of the faithful, by moſt evident Sacraments, and clear ſigns of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>Sin cannot then hurt them, the divel is chained up in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs pit, their adverſaries have their portion alſo with him; ſo that there is none found to hurt in all the holy mountain. What greater ſecurity, when all fear of miſcarriage is quite done away? No enemies appear from within, nor any from without; all are vanquiſhed and brought under the footſtool of the Lamb, that ſitteth upon the Throne: Then it may be ſaid, <hi>O death! Where is thy ſtirg? O grave! Where is thy victory?</hi> And as if the treading under all enemies were not enough to ſecure this bleſſed eſtate, and make it compleatly happy, there is added the Tree of life, to eat thereof; not as if there were fear of death, but ſymbolically, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, hieroglyphically, or emblematically, to manifeſt and confirm the perpetuity and continuation of that moſt glorious and bleſſed ſtate for ever.</p>
                  <p>But it may be objected, Is not Paradice taken in Scripture for the ſupernal heaven? and is it here to be taken thus? That <hi>he that overcometh ſhall eat of the Tree of life, in the midſt of the Paradice of God;</hi> that is, ſhall be tranſlated to the heavenly manſions above, where the Angels, and ſouls of the bleſſed remain in glory, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere ſhall eat of the Tree of life; that is, ſhall participate of Chriſt in his glory and eternal life, in the ſupernal heavens.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt Negatively, This Paradice that is given to the chriſtian conquerors, cannot be in this place, nor that of cap. 22. v. 28. whereunto this hath relation, and correſpond both in ſenſe and reaſon, be underſtood of the ſupernal heavens, for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Firſt, Becauſe in this Paradice it is ſaid, There is the Tree of life, whoſe leaves are for the healing of the Nations: Now in the heavens above, there is no healing or converſion, that muſt be done here beneath, or not at all</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the ſupernal heavens, there are neither Streets, nor Rivers, Gates, nor Foundations; as this Paradice is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially deſcribed in chap. 21, and 22.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Paradice is meaſured to a certain proportion, cap. 21. 15, 16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how ſhort that meaſure, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cubits of a man, is to ſpanior fathom the ſupernal heavens, let him that hath the leaſt grain of reaſon judge.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It cannot be intended of the higheſt heavens, becauſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53073:88"/>
this Paradice or New Jeruſalem is ſaid to deſcend, or come down out of heaven from God, and that the Tabernacle of God is with men, and that he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Now how improper and diſſonant from right reaſon is it to ſay, that the ſupernal heavens do deſcend and come down unto the children of men? And how needleſs is it for God to promiſe that he will be the God of his people in the higheſt heavens, and that he will dwell with them there? All know it is the place of his habitation, where his glorious preſence is moſt eminent and reſplendent.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I anſwer poſitively, That this Paradice which is here promiſed to the faithful conquerors in Chriſt, is a Terreſtrial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice: It is a heaven on earth, though not an earthly one: It is a holy City, a New Jeruſalem, a New Heaven, and a New Earth, that comes down from God, cap. 21. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if it be not on earth, what need is there of the mention of a New Earth? In the ſupernal heavens there is no place for the performance of ſuch a promiſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. which place hath relation to that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17. where God promiſeth the Jews New Heavens, and a New Earth; and withal there mentions, the enjoyment of Houſes and Vineyards: and how theſe things can be attributed or conſiſt in the ſupernal heaven, or how things there may be ſaid to be meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orated, made new, or better then they are, paſſeth my reaſon to comprehend? Though withal I grant, That the ſupernal heaven may be repreſented by Paradice, as in that of <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. But more properly, The firſt Paradice may ſerve to typifie or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſecond Paradice, or new Church-ſtate, or heaven, which Chriſt will reſtore unto his faithful ones, before the ultimate day, and end of all.

                  <p>Chriſt having finiſhed his charge to the church of Epheſus, goes on on the ſame account with the church of Smyrna, and commands the Angel, or chief Paſtor, or Miniſter of the ſaid church, who (as <hi>Ireneus</hi> teſtifies) was <hi>Policarpus,</hi> ſcholar unto S. <hi>John,</hi> to write thoſe things for them to take notice of, which he was about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to them: The perſon that gave out theſe diſcoveries and charges to the churches, is here plainly manifeſted to be Chriſt, who was dead, and is alive, as in v. 18. of the precedent chapter more fully. The matter of the diſcovery is wholly of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and approbation; <hi>I know thy works, and tribulation, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53073:88"/>
but thou art rich:</hi> that is, I know thy works, thou church of Smyrna, and the trouble, affliction, and tribulation that thou endureſt by reaſon of the opprobrious, ſcandalous, and reviling ſpeeches which thoſe caſt out againſt thee, which call themſelves Jews, and are not: And I know thy poverty, and ſcantineſs in worldly riches; but I add withal, thou art rich in ſpiritual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and though thou art accounted poor in this world, yet thou haſt treaſures abiding for thee in heaven: And withal, I know the blaſphemy of them which ſay they are Jews, and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan: As if he had ſaid, I alſo know and take notice of the reviling ſpeeches that thoſe which call themſelves Jews (and ſo perhaps were ſo by blood) and yet are not true Jews, true ſpiritual Iſraelites, but rather by reaſon of their unbelief, and malicious practiſes, and perſecution of the truth, and the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thereof, are the very divel's diſciples, and of the Synagogue of Satan: Here is a two-fold knowledge, or ſeveral acts of one and the ſame knowledge, and far different the one from the other: The one is a knowledge of approbation, love, and complacency, the other of hatred and abhorrency. Chriſt knows the works of the church of Smyrna, of her tribulation, perſecution, and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and loves her, and honours her for it. Chriſt alſo knows the works of her adverſaries, of blaſphemies, reproaches, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements to evil, againſt the true Profeſſors of godlineſs; and not only hates them for it, but ſets a character of ignominy upon their head for ever: for what may be more reproachful or ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, then for thoſe that think themſelves ſomwhat in the church of God, that call themſelves Jews, the keepers of the Oracles and myſteries of God, yet indeed, to be juſtly numbred among the diſciples of the Synagogue of Satan; that is, of the divel's church: for the word Synagogue, in the Greek ſignifies ſo much as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, Meeting, or Church, which is commonly uſed now in the worſer ſenſe, which was appropriated firſt, chiefly to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Phariſaical and Prieſtly meetings, and called the Jewiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; but Chriſtians having renounced the name and thing, have appropriated to their meetings or conventions, a more ſignificant name, to wit, the Church, <hi>Eccleſia;</hi> and leaves the Synagogue to unbelieving Jews, Antichriſt, and the Divel, to nouriſh their Diſciples in. From Chriſt taking knowledge, with approbation, of the works and tribulations of the church of Smyrna, ſee the Notes on v. 2. of this chapter, to which I refer. But from this verſe explained, one Note ſhall be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That a poor afflicted and perſecuted church of Chriſt, is more dear, precious, and rich in his eye, then all other the potent, rich, and mighty Societies in the world.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt looks upon the latter, but with an eye of common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as the Sun ſhineth, and ſhower falleth on the field of the righteous and unrighteous alike; herein there is no diſtinction of love or mercy: God equally diſpenſeth thoſe common gifts equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53073:89"/>
alike unto all; neither is any one to be accounted godly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, elect or reprobate, from the abounding or want thereof; for ſome godly have abounded, and others have wanted herein: But the church of Chriſt, they have diſtinguiſhing mercies, their afflictions and tears are treaſured up in a bottle of remembrance, for a reward and crown unto them: they are as the apple of his eye, his jewels, members of his myſtical body, and therefore muſt needs be dear unto him; for no man ever hated his own fleſh, for them the world was made, and is preſerved and continued to this day for their ſakes; and I dare be bold to affirm, if there were none of his elect members on earth, the world would ſoon ſee its night and period, and forthwith relapſe to its primitive and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chaos, or at leaſt, paſs away, and periſh, that its place be no more found. Chriſt is ſtill walking amongſt thoſe golden Candleſticks, viewing their order, and takes his delight in thoſe Gardens, and Beds of Spices, and ſo gets up early into theſe Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, to ſee if the Vine flouriſh, whether the tender Grape ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and the Pomgranates bud forth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.12. his delight was ever to be with the children of men, and takes much pleaſure, not only in ſeeing and ſmelling the ſavoury exerciſes, and ſpiritual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the more grown chriſtians, but alſo takes much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in viewing the growth, production, and fruitfulneſs of younger chriſtians, and leads them gently by the hand, by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline, until at laſt they are brought unto the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellars of his love, where he bids them to take their fill of love; but by the way, comforts them with apples, and ſtays them with flaggons, till at laſt he bring them home unto himſelf, purified and cleanſed by the purgatory of afflictions and tribulations, as gold, ſeven times tryed by the fire of the Chymiſter. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine uſe of this is, to demonſtrate the danger of perſecution of Chriſt's members or churches, to all perſons in the world. They are his members, and in as much as it is done to one of them, it is done unto himſelf; and better a milſtone were hanged about the neck of ſuch offenders, and caſt into the Sea, then to offend one of his little ones.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons that Chriſt's churches, though afflicted, ſcorned, or perſecuted, are ſo dear and precious to him, are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe they are his Members, and it is moſt natural to love ones ſelf; for he that loves not himſelf, cannot love another, and we are bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe of their graces and unction; we having received all of his fulneſs, grace for grace, and of the ſame anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with himſelf, though in an inferiour meaſure: The ſame oyl that was poured on <hi>Aarons</hi> head, ran down to the skirts of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo the ſame unction of the Spirit, that was poured on Chriſt, is, in ſome meaſure, poured on all his inferiour members, and therefore moſt dear and beloved to him. <hi>Omne ſimile, gaudet ſimili.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:53073:89"/>Thirdly, By reaſon of Union, Chriſt and his Members bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> one, by a myſtical and ſpiritual union, they muſt needs be moſt dear and precious to him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; the great reaſon that Chriſt's Saints and churches are moſt dear unto him, is, In that he hath laid down his own moſt precious life for them: for <hi>greater love then this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhown, in that he died for us, even whiles we were fighters againſt God, and enemies by evil works.</hi>

Another Note is, That though the world looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faithful diſtreſſed churches of Chriſt, as a broken, poor, and forſaken people, both in outward eſtates, and intellectuals alſo, yet God ſets another rate upon them, and accounts them rich, wiſe, mighty, comly, beautiful, and as the moſt accompliſhed people in the world.</p>
                  <p>Is not this a ſtrange Paradox to the infatuated worldling? But it is not ſo ſtrange, as true: Chriſt here calls his poor afflicted Smyrna rich; for ſhe was rich indeed with ſpiritual graces, that their perſecuting adverſaries were ignorant of; ſhe was rich in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortible Treaſures, laid up for her ſervice in heaven above, where moth could not corrupt, or thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>I anſwer, Indeed they were not worthy to be called Iews, who had many eminent priviledges peculiar to their Nation; our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> could boaſt that he was an Ebrew of the Hebrews, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. they had much advantage every way; chiefly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe unto them were committed the Oracles of God, and the word of peace and reconciliation by Chriſt, was firſt to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto them, then next unto the Gentiles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5.

                  <p>Yet ſecondly, I ſay, they muſt needs be the ſame Iews, of the ſame blood and progenie that oppoſed, perſecuted, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Paul,</hi> and other true churches of Chriſt alſo, with thoſe found, blaſpheming, reviling, and perſecuting in Smyrna and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, being ſo like one the other in their curſed practiſes.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly I anſwer, Though they ſay they are Iews, yet indeed are not; for he is not a Iew that is one outward, but he is a true Iew, a true Iſraelite of God, that is one inward: It is not he that tals and boaſts of his carnal priviledges and birth-right, as from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and does not the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is a Iew, but ſuch an one is a true ſpiritual Iew, that walks in the ſteps of faithful <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> but for thoſe reviling perſecuting Iews, they were rather to be termed <hi>Rabſhekahs,</hi> and Barbarians, then Iews; for their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was become unto them, by reaſon of their impieties and blaſphemies againſt the truth, uncircumciſion, and therefore not worthy to be called Iews: Iuſt as a nominal chriſtian, when turned antichriſtian, and a blaſphemer and perſecutor of the true profeſſion of Chriſt, who will think him worthy of the name of chriſtian? And though he arrogates to himſelf that name and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſays (as the Iews here did) he is a chriſtian, who will not ſay unto him, he is not, but a lyar, and a Barbarian, or at beſt, an antichriſtian.</p>

luſts, as the Nicolaitans were, denying the holy Laws of God, ſo by theſe Diabolical artifices, to bring them into contempt with the whole world, and ſo under the rod of perſecution and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. See the charge of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the Orator of the Jews, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 24.5, 6, &amp;c. tending partly to this effect: and the Jews perceiving the hereſies of the Nicolaitans, Gnoſticks, and others, of like unclean practiſes, to creep in among the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, were bold to reproach them, as all ſuch, and of the ſame unclean judgements and practices with the former. Conſider the words of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to this purpoſe, out of M. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s book of Infidelity, page 131. Which ſort of men (ſays he) Satan ſeems to have fitted, and ſent for a reproach, and ſtumbling block to the church of God; and having put on themſelves the names of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that for their ſakes the Nations being offended, ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the profit of the church of God, and ſhould refuſe the truth declared to them, becauſe of their ſavage wickedneſs, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible vileneſs; that I ſay, their frequent vilanies being taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, they might perſwade themſelves, that thoſe are ſuch, that are of the holy church of God, and ſo may turn away their ears (as I ſaid) from the true doctrine of God; or at leaſt, beholding the diſhoneſty of a few, might caſt the ſame reproaches upon all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe doubtleſs were the advantages that the Jews took, to blaſpheme the churches of Chriſt with, and ſo to make Chriſt's doctrine and followers ſeem abominable, whiles ſome that were called chriſtians, were truly and worthily abominable. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice and method Satan keeps ſtill afoot to this day, to vilifie Chriſt's Truth's, and his followers, by terming their doctrines Novel, and new Lights, though of above 1600 years ſtanding, and of Apoſtolical Inſtitution; and if they prove faithful Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of it, are preſently termed factious, or Schiſmatical for it, being (as they ſay) Diſturbers of the National Peace, perverters of Cuſtoms, Laws, and Governments, and forthwith branded with Anti-magiſtratical, and Anti-Miniſterial Titles; as if they were againſt Magiſtracy; when they ſay in the firſt place, Fear God; in the next, Honour the King: Or if they were againſt all Miniſters, becauſe they are againſt the formal, lazie, and belly-god Prieſts, whoſe very forms, as carnal ordinances, are periſhed with uſing, and in the room thereof, deſires a Miniſtery, ſound, able, godly, efficacious, ſpiritual, and more edifying in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and churches of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, if any defection happens in the churches of Chriſt, as if ſome among them turn looſe Nicolaitans, or the like, there will not be wanting the Nominal Jews, formal chriſtians, to blaſpheme them, as if they were all of that feather. The Papiſts, as ſoon as they heard of ſome hereſies broken forth among the Proteſtants, preſently cry out, and blaſpheme the whole name of Proteſtants, as if they were all of that hereſie. Among the old Epiſcopal men of our Nation, it was a common ſaying, That a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53073:92"/>
Geneva Presbytery made a fair gap, and was a downright way to Browniſm and Anabaptiſm, as M. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Preface to his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Policy manifeſts. And if any Non-conformiſt turned Anabaptiſt or Browniſt, preſently they would ſay the Presbyters were all ſuch: And again, if any Independent, or Baptiſt now a days, became a Familiſtical Quaker, or Antiſcripturiſt, preſently the Presbyters lay the ſame harſh judgement and contumely upon the whole churches of the ſame profeſſion, to render them abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the eyes of all; as if the eleven Apoſtles were all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſes, becauſe one in twelve was a Judas. This Satanical me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod ſhould be quite laid by, by ſuch as have truly learned Chriſt. This was the old Jewiſh trick and ſtratagem, againſt the primitive precious Aſiatique churches of Chriſt, who were not all Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans, becauſe ſome Nicolaitans were crept in among them, but precious in the eye of God, both for their graces, and ſufferings for the teſtimony of Jeſus. But for ſuch as will blaſpheme the true doctrines of Chriſt, and the Profeſſors thereof, by means of the evil among them, and to caſt a reproach, tribulation, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction thereby upon them all, let them too withal not be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to read their judgement in this verſe, <hi>Whiles they ſay they are Jews, and are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.</hi>

Theſe poor Jews had an indubitable aim and zeal to glorifie God, for ſo <hi>Paul</hi> bears teſtimony of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. but it was exerciſed amiſs, in that it was not according unto knowledge; if their judgement had been rightly informed, or bore the leaſt proportion with their zeal, they would not perſecute the diſciples of Chriſt from city to city, and from Town to Town, much leſs put the Lord of life to death amongſt them.

                  <p>Before the ten great days of perſecution fell on the primitive Aſian churches, Chriſt tells them, Fear not thoſe things which ye ſhall ſuffer, though impriſonments, and death it ſelf attend you; for it is only for your tryal, and that your faith may be more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, by your conſtant Martyrdom, in the face of all your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; yea, it is the way and method that Chriſt builds his Church by, by the way of the croſs and ſufferings. <hi>Sanguis Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum, ſemen Eccleſiae;</hi> The Martyrs blood was God's ſeed-plot of his Church and Truth. There is no promiſe that God's Saints ſhall be freed from Tryals, but there is a faithful promiſe that they ſhall not ſink under it; for, he will lay no more on them, then they are able to bear: If God calls any to witneſs his truth by tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perſecution, he gives them hearts of courage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53073:93"/>
to bear it; he adminiſters ſutable ſtrength unto the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the ſtrong in faith have ſtronger tryals then the weak, yet both are preſerved by a divine ſupply and influence, that neither periſh under them. <hi>Peter</hi> is deſired by Satan, to be winnowed as wheat, yet <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall be ſtill <hi>Peter,</hi> a Rock; for Chriſt hath prayed for him. <hi>Job</hi> is given into the hand of Satan to be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in al that he has, and is dear unto him, yet <hi>Job</hi> by this means is preſerved and made an everlaſting example of faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all generations to come.

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. Another Note is, That wicked tyrannical men, in the impriſonments and perſecutions of the Saints of Chriſt, are ſaid to do the work of the divel.</p>
                  <p>We well know, that the divel himſelf did not caſt thoſe poor perſecuted Saints of Smyrna into priſon, but they were divelliſh and wicked men, who were as the Inſtruments of Satan, to do his work, and ſet his deſigns in execution. O ſad to conſider! When men open their mouths againſt the Saints in blaſphemies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, their mouths are only Satans Organs, that he belches out his malice by: when they lift up their hands againſt them, in loading them with perſecutions and tribulations, they are but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans wheels, whereby he moves and acts all his vilanies, yea, and are called Satan himſelf. Conſider ſeriouſly this, all ye that lift up your tongues and hands againſt the Saints of God, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. Another Note is, God's ends, and the divel's, are far different in laying afflictions and tribulations on the Saints.</p>
                  <p>God's end is, That they may be tryed, not deſtroyed; as gold is caſt into the Refiners fire, that it may come forth more purified, ſo God's Saints are caſt into the fire of tribulations, that they may be purged from their droſs, kept cloſer, and more undefiled unto him, then before: The divel's end is, that they may not only be broken under affliction and tribulation, (and therefore he is termed Apollyon, a Deſtroyer; becauſe he delights in the deſtruction and ruine of the godly) but alſo he aims and intends thereby, to vilifie the truth of God, and if poſſibly he can, to bring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the truth, by heaping afflictions on them, to impatience, and become wayward towards God and his truth; and as <hi>Job</hi>'s wifes advice was unto her husband, to bring him unto a deſperate condition, to curſe God and die. This is Satans deſigne in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the godly, either that they thereby may become Daſtards, and Apoſtates unto the Truth, that both the truth and godly may be vilified and ſcandalized, or elſe, that they may provoke God
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53073:93"/>
by their fooliſh, wayward, and impatient carriage under it, and ſo provoke God to become their adverſary, and to chaſtiſe them for it. Satan doth indeed deſire to winnow us as wheat, but ſure not for our good, not to cleanſe away our Tares and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Satan is on another pin, he deſires thereby to draw us further from God, and God alſo from us, if he may, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking him againſt us by our untoward carriages under the rod. O Lord, lay no more on us, nor give power to Satan to touch us, farther then thou haſt given us ſtrength and ability from thy ſelf to reſiſt, or bear with patience, and ſo we pray, Lead us not into temptatation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, God tempteth no man, according to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.13. How then ſay you, that God tempts, and the divel tempts?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, Indeed God that is the Author of all good cannot be the Author of evil, as evil is a ſin, and an obliquity to his holy and righteous Laws, for he is God, and unchangeable holineſs it ſelf, and therefore he never preſents ſeducements, or motions to ſin. This is the proper work of Satan, and their own luſts, and far from the nature of the unchangeable holineſs of God.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, God tempts, as temptation is taken for tryal, and ſo tries the obedience and faith of his children, by divers temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and afflictions, as he did <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But again you will ſay, Does not God in his inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Decrees and Providences, caſt us neceſſarily upon the objects and temptations unto ſin, therefore may be ſaid to be author of them, and to tempt thereunto.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It was God's providence that the wedge of gold lay in <hi>Achans</hi> way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it was the purpoſe and decree of God from everlaſting, that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould betray his innocent maſter; and it was by God's providence that <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was preſented naked to <hi>David</hi>'s eye, yet this doth not at all make God the author of ſin, nor render <hi>Achan, Judas,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> the leſs culpable for their ſins; for God's ſecret Decrees, and providential dealings with, and towards his creatures, are no rules of duty unto us, nor ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us more excuſable for our failings; for God does neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force our wills, either phyſically or morally, by urging or encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to act in ſinful ways, or by counſelling or perſwading thereunto; for that (as I ſaid before) is againſt his holy Nature, and ſo tempteth no man; but when we are drawn aſide, it is by our own luſts and concupiſcences, God is free from the charge thereof, otherwiſe then as the Sun that caſts his efficacious beams

on a ſtinking dunghil, makes it ſend forth unſavoury vapours; the neareſt cauſe is the intrinſique corruption of the dunghil, the Sun is only a more remote cauſe, he only ſends forth (as it were) its providential heat, whereby the dunghil is enflam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, and ſo ſends forth from its corrupted wombe, moſt unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtenches and ſavours: So God emits his comfortable beams of providences towards us, ſpreads our tables with good things, and our own baſe luſts make them a ſnare unto us; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with objects of Beauty, as a remedy againſt ſin, and our baſe hearts and luſts makes them occaſions to ſin: God gives us the fruit of the Vine to cheriſh us, and we turn them to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The providence of God diſpoſes riches and honours on us for good ends, and we employ them on our luſts, uſurpations, and grinding the poor. All the creatures of God are in themſelves good, phiſically conſidered, and we tacitely reflect on God as the author of our ſin, when we lay the blame of our ſins on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions thereof. Women, wine, riches, honours, are excellent creatures of God, and for ſingular uſes and comforts unto men, but the occaſions that are taken thereby to ſin, riſe not from any innate quality in thoſe objects, for they all are good; but from the luſts of the heart of man; conſider that of 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. The corruption that is in the world through luſt: the world is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, luſt is the cauſe. The reaſon that men are covetous, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, voluptuous, drunkards, ſenſual, &amp;c. is not in riches, gold, wine, women, &amp;c. but in mens moſt corrupt and naughty affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſpoſitions of heart, which does, as the Spider or Toad by their own corrupt natures, turn the extraction of the ſweeteſt flowers into poyſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But again, doth not many Scriptures ſay, that God tempteth man? As <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. God tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> God tempted, or moved <hi>David</hi> to number the people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1. God ſtirred up <hi>Pul</hi> King of Aſſiria, to carry away the Jews captive 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.26. and alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.25. he turned their heart to hate his people, and to deal ſubtilly with his ſervants. Thus alſo 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.22. Thou ſhalt be a lying ſpirit, go forth, and do ſo, and thou ſhalt prevail. It is alſo ſaid <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26, 28. that God delivers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to a reprobate ſenſe, and to ſend ſtrong deluſions, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. It is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph, Gen</hi> 45.5, 8. ſpeaking to his Brethren, Be not grieved nor offended, it was not you that ſent me hither, it was not you, but God: Or that, Is there any evil in the City, but God is in it? <hi>Amos</hi> 3. And many other places ſay, That God delivered Chriſt to be bruiſed and afflicted by his unbelieving enemies, which was an evil act. Therefore from thoſe, and the like places it may fully be objected, that God tempteth to evil, and hath a hand in ſin and iniquity.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, We muſt be careful to diſtinguiſh between temptations that are in themſelves ſimply ſinful, and thoſe that are not ſo: God may juſtly try the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by calling him
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53073:94"/>
to ſacrifice his only ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for he is the God and Maker of the whole Creation, and therefore without any injuſtice or ſin, can call for the life of any of his creatures. God can lay afflictions on <hi>Job,</hi> and who can queſtion his righteouſneſs for it? God can cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe the church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> with ten days of tribulation, and who ſhall lay any thing to his charge? Tryals and temptations on this account, are not ſimply evil, neither are they abſolutely to be deprecated, but with a ſubmiſſion unto the Will of God; for though no affliction at preſent ſeemeth joyous, but grievous, yet the fruits thereof are eternal life: If our judgement were rightly enlightned, we would not look upon the afflicting hand of God, or his tryals by the croſs, a bitter thing, conſidering the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and conſequents thereof, even mortification of ſin, and a crown of eternal life. If God comes with ſharp corrections and Tryals on us, be ſure we have ſtrong corruptions to be mortified, and if we are called to great tryals, our hopes are the greater, and more ſublime; and indeed, a faithful chriſtian is of that heroick ſpirit, that he can look upon all the ſufferings of this preſent world with an eye of contempt, and not worthy to be compared with the joys that ſhall be revealed, and ſo with <hi>Moſes,</hi> can eſteem the reproach of Chriſt, better then the treaſures of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and ſo often on this ſcore, God tries his children, and this is for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, not for their worſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, I anſwer, When ye read that God moves or tempts to that act that is ſinful, it is either permiſſively, or judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moſt commonly underſtood; as when God moves <hi>David</hi> to number the people, it was on God's part both permiſſively, and judicially: for, <hi>the anger of the Lord was kindled against Iſrael, and he moved</hi> David <hi>to number the people,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.1. God ſuffered it, and that judicially, but Satan did it maliciouſly, and deſtructively: God ſuffered, Satan tempted; God judicially permitted it, Satan executed it: for it is ſaid 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. <hi>Satan ſtood up, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> David <hi>to number the people:</hi> So it was a judicial act of God, to ſtir up <hi>Pul</hi> of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to carry away a rebellious people (the Jews) into captivity, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.26. God only permits the lying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to go forth to deceive <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> 1 Kings 22. and ſo permits the Egyptians to deal deceitfully with his people the Jews, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.25. that thereby, he might riſe in judgement againſt them: And where it is ſaid, that God delivers over to a reprobate ſenſe, to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the heart, to blinden, or ſend ſtrong deluſions, God does it moſt juſtly and judicially to puniſh evil with evil, adminiſters oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſin, that the ſins of the obſtinate may be heightned and aggravated, that their judgements may be the greater; and in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that was wickedly handled by his brethren, yet it is ſaid, that God ſent him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there is no evil done in the City, but God is ſaid to do it; yea, if it be rebellion it ſelf, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.15. Firſt, God pre-ordains it, intends, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſhould be. Next, He permits it, and that not by an idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53073:95"/>
but by an efficacious permiſſion: then he diſpoſes the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents thereof to his own glory, according to his pre-ordained pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and decrees. And laſtly, God is ſaid to deliver Chriſt, to bruiſe and afflict him; that is, God pre-ordains him to that end, and hinders it not, but permits it, by a providential aſſiſtance and co-operation, by which every phyſical action of the creatures comes to paſs; for, in him we live, move, and have our being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But then it ſeems you make God to have a great hand or efficiency in and about ſin.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, There would be no ſin, if God had not given the commandment; If there were no Law, there were no tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither is it beſide the Will of God, nor againſt his Will; for if it were, then he were not God omniſcient, or omnipotent: neither can we, without a continued concurrence and ſupportation of providence, produce any action or work of ours, wherein there is ſin; and therefore God has an agency, and concurrence in the action wherein ſin is, but not in the ſinfulneſs of the action: as the Sun that emits his efficacious beams upon a dunghil, yet it ſelf is undefiled from the corruption of the dunghil; ſo God that has his hand and efficiency about ſin, is far from mixing with the obliquities of the creature; neither can he be ſaid to be the direct author of it, nor the next proper cauſe thereof; ſin is only a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral being or entity, and it hath ſubſiſtence alone in our corrupt natures; but all our phyſical actions are good, wherein God hath a concurrence, and they become ill, or ſinful, by our own depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities; and ſo the divel, and our own luſts, are the mixt proper authors and fountains of all ſin: So, let God be juſtified, and all men lyars.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yet I ſay, God hath his hand and efficiency about ſin, ſeveral manner of ways; and for diſtinct method ſake, I ſhall briefly ſet them down.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God foreſees, and pre-ordains it, elſe, as I ſaid, it could not come to paſs, ſeeing God is omniſcient, and omnipotent, to hinder it if he would, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. Chriſt was delivered by the fore knowledge, and determinate counſel of God: What was a greater ſin, then the betraying the innocent, and that too, the Saviour of the world? Yet this was pre-ordained of God, and he meant to draw excellent good out of it: and <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.19, 20. <hi>Joſeph</hi> tells his brethren, <hi>As for you, ye thought evil, but God meant it for good, to bring it to paſs, as it is this day, to ſave much people alive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God permits it. God's Decrees imply a neceſſity, that ſin ſhall be, but do not impel or enforce thereunto: We being left to our free choice, God is not bound to hinder us; he ſuffered them to walk in their own ways, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. and we being left unto our own choice, without God's ſpecial grace, we are ſure to chuſe the worſer part.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath his concurrence in every action wherein ſin is, but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53073:95"/>
not in the obliquity of it; all our actions and motions are from God, but the ſinfulneſs thereof is from the luſts of the heart of man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God withdraws his preventing Grace, or ſuſpends it from a ſinner; for God is not bound up to Laws and conditions unto us, and he may do it out of Soveraignty, and he will do it, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in wiſdom, to try us, and ſee whether we will ſeek after him, and keep cloſe unto him, as he did to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.31. <hi>God left Hezekiah, that he might know what was in his heart:</hi> So ſomtimes he withdraws his grace in Juſtice and Judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. God gives a conceſſion and permiſſion to wicked Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſtir up and move to evil, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.22. <hi>I will go forth, and be a lying Spirit in the mouth of Abab's Prophets: And God ſaid, Go forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. God wiſely diſpoſes his Providences, that they become a ſnare unto the ſinner, and yet no diſhonour to God; for his acts of Providences are in themſelves good, and are rather motives to holineſs and duty, if our hearts were ſound, then temptations to ſin; yea, his very mercies will become unto them a ſnare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. <hi>Let their Table become a ſnare, and their Welfare a Trap.</hi> A ſinner (like the Sea) will make all it receives brackiſh, though ever ſo ſweet that runs into it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. God's hand is converſant about ſin, as ſome of his judiciary puniſhments that he afflicts the ſinner with, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. <hi>God gave them up to vile affections, and gave them ſtrong deluſions:</hi> When we leave God and his ways, juſtly may he give us up to our own luſts and perverſe ways, in a Judiciary way, and to a reprobate ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. God limits ſin: Thus far thou ſhalt go, and no farther, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.10. <hi>The wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee, and the remainder thereof ſhalt thou reſtrain:</hi> So far as God gets glory by the permiſſion of ſin, God will let the ſinner take his ſwing, but it ſhall not exceed its bounds, but can preſently deſtroy it, or ſtop the current of it in an inſtant: And ſo the remainders of wrath thou wilt reſtrain.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. God diſpoſes the events and ends of all ſin to his glory. God would never permit ſin, if he could not bring good out of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin (as one wittily ſaid) was a happy ſin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it made way for the grace of God to be more clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto the creature: Many of God's attributes would never be ſo clearly advanced, if it were not for ſin; to wit, his mercy in pardoning, juſtice in puniſhing, wiſdom in ordering, power in over-ruling it: Let us never therefore murmure againſt God for pre-ordaining and permitting ſin; for though the wages thereof be death, yet thanked be God, we have Victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. Another Note from the words, <hi>The Divel ſhall caſt ſome of you in priſon,</hi> is, <hi>That it is the Saints great comfort, to know that their impriſonments and afflictions comes from Satan and his wicked inſtruments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s rule was, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as an evil doer.</hi> The comfort of ſufferings will be quite abated by the guilt of ſin: neither muſt the Saints ſufferings be voluntary, and out of choice; for unto ſuch it may one day be ſaid, <hi>Who required theſe things at your hands?</hi> There muſt be a juſt call unto afflicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that muſt make them comfortable to us: It is but a fond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, to caſt our ſelves upon impriſonments and tribulations, Satan and his wicked inſtruments will be apt enough to do it, and in that we may truly rejoyce, that Chriſt hath thought us worthy to be Martyrs to his Truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.12. and hath given us ſo ſure and ſtrong a token of our Intereſt in him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a ſight of that glory of our intereſt, which we then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that condition muſt virtually and ſtrongly enjoy in him by faith; but ſuch are very fond, that will deſire to fall into impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments and tribulations out of an affectation to Martyrdom, as many of the Quakers of theſe days do: and Chriſt hath taught us to pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation;</hi> and this had not been taught us, had it not been grievous and evil to fall into it, whether it were either the temptation unto ſin, or temptation of affliction or the croſs; for Chriſt himſelf prayed when his ſoul was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled within him, <hi>Father, ſave me from this hour,</hi> and, <hi>Let this Cup paſs from me,</hi> John 12.27. though Chriſt ſubmitted to the will of his Father, and freely choſe death and ſufferings, as our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, yet as a private perſon, he would manifeſt the ſame affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in us, and deprecate the evil of ſufferings, if poſſibly he could: Therefore for us to deſire or ruſh into them, would be a mad zeal, and irregular, and not according to ſound knowledge: but if we deſire to wait on God ſincerely, and live godly, we need not fear of want of perſecution or tribulations; for that is the common lot of all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus; for Satan is the great contriver and promoter of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. From the words, <hi>And ye ſhall have tribulation ten days.</hi> Note, <hi>That the afflictions of Gods people, are but for a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite time and ſeaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The tribulation that paſſed over the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> was but for ten days; that is, ten prophetical days, or years, as ſome will have it: But I rather ſhould underſtand ten days, to be ten times of perſecution; for it is to be obſerved, that days in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical writings, do ſignifie times, as well as years: as in that of <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Seven times ſhall paſs over thee;</hi> and in verſe 31. it is rendred, <hi>And at the end of thoſe days, I Nebuchadnezzar lift up mine eyes to heaven,</hi> Rev. 12.6. compared to verſ. 14.

                     <hi>Smyrna,</hi> ſhould be the ten great days or time of perſecution that ſhould befal the Churches of Chriſt under the Kingdom of the red Dragon, the Heatheniſh Emperours.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, I ſay, This doth not at all derogate from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; for he doth not afflict his children as a Judge, <hi>de merito,</hi> for the guilt of ſin; for that is already done upon the Surety: but he does it in wiſdom, as a loving father would do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his childe, keep him under the rod of correction, to prevent him from running into future evils: and ſo God deals here with the Smyrnians, that they may be tryed, that is, refined from their droſs, and become more purer mettal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God ſeeth or judgeth, not as man judgeth. We ſee nothing publiquely laid to the charge of the church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but is ſet forth as one of the moſt eminent and faireſt of the ſeven Siſter churches, both for faith, piety, and ſufferings; and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily too ſhe did deſerve it in the eye of all: yet God could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that ſhe would turn wanton and prodigal as well as the reſt, and that ſhe had the ſame heart of corruptions within, as the others had, and therefore had need of the rod of correction, to keep her cloſe to Chriſt: And this in few Ages did appear by their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereby their candleſticks were removed from amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When God chaſtiſes and afflicts his children, it is not to be look'd upon as an act of Juſtice, but of Grace. <hi>To you it is given to ſuffer,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 1.29. It is an act of honour and ſervice, when we are ſingled out to be Martyrs for the Truth of Chriſt before men and Angels. And hence the Primitive Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. <hi>They went away rejoycing, that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt.:</hi> Yea, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Baſtards, and not beloved children, if God chaſtens them not. It is God's rod, as well as ſtaff doth comfort them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another reaſon that God afflicts his moſt innocent children, and the godly, is, The Truths of Chriſt are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53073:97"/>
thereby. What though the godly ſhould ſuffer death, that is but gain unto them, and the church alſo gaineth by it: for the enemies of Chriſt ſeeing their patience and fortitude, have been often converted to the Chriſtian faith, as Antiquity teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Sanguis Martyrum, ſemen Eccleſiae.</hi> Juſt as an Oak that liveth by its own wounds: The more blood of Chriſtians was ſpilt in the primitive days, the more they were multiplyed. The church was firſt founded in the blood of Chriſt, and it thrives beſt when they fulfil the remainder of the ſufferings of Chriſt in their own bodies: Therefore think it not ſtrange, nor againſt the Juſtice of God, when he caſts his children into divers tribulations.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God does afflict his beſt children to try them. The ordinary ſtrokes of God's providence, as loſſes, croſſes, ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the like, are more properly corrections then tryals. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections great end is, either to mortifie ſin, or to keep from ſin; and to that end, God often takes the rod of affliction and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into his hand: But Tryals that God ſends us by Satan, or his Inſtruments, aim chiefly at the diſcovery and maintenance of our graces; and therefore when ſuch befal us, they bring more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts and experiences with them then ordinary croſſes of Providence, according to that of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5 <hi>For as the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo alſo conſolation aboundeth by Chriſt:</hi> Theſe are the two ways that God carries his Saints unto a crown of eternal life: They muſt be firſt hewen, before they will make fit ſtones for the building of the New Jeruſalem: Gold muſt paſs thorow the Refiners fire, before it come unto its perfection. Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and the Croſs, though not meritorious for heaven, yet are Antecedents thereunto: It is thorow much tribulation that we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God; for we have much droſs and ſin within us, to be clenſed from us, before we ſhall be made meet for the inheritance of the Saints in light, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. And this work is much promoted by afflictions, which makes us more heavenly, and meet for the communion of Saints: For, <hi>before we were afflicted</hi> (as <hi>David) we went aſtray,</hi> but ſince, we have clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cloſe to his commandments: Wherefore when we enter into divers tribulations, let us not judge, that God hath done it in wrath and judgement, but rather as a gracious father, either to wean us from ſin, preſerve us againſt ſin, or to approve and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our gifts and graces: Under Tribulations, ſincere graces are diſtinguiſhed from guilded or hypocritical, true faith from a feigned faith, and the ſtrong from the weak. Here is the patience and faith of the Saints in their higheſt glory, and in their greateſt fragrancy; therefore I conclude in S. <hi>James</hi> words, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>My Brethren, count it all joy, when you fall into divers temptations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> From the words, <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death, and thou ſhalt have a Crown of life.</hi> Note, <hi>The Crown and reward is for him that faithfully perſevers under ſufferings for Chriſts ſake unto the end.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:53073:97"/>He that leaves off half way, is never like to win the prize: Heaven is ſet forth as a crown and reward of our faithfulneſs, though not for the merit of the work, but according to the work it is freely given; as wicked works ſhall not paſs unpuniſhed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall good works, or our faithfulneſs towards Chriſt, paſs unrewarded. <hi>Every one ſhall receive according as he hath done in the fleſh, whether good or evil:</hi> And he that hath fought the good fight of faith, and perſeveres therein under all afflictions, and that even to death, he is the true chriſtian conquerour, and for him is laid up the crown of eternal life: The true militant chriſtian muſt not look for the crown, if he turn's back to the enemy: and that which is moſt admirable herein, is, that the method of obtaining this crown, is far different from that of obtaining worldly crowns: they are got by over-maſtering and ſurviving the enemy, but the chriſtians crown is gotten by ſuffering and dying; the chriſtians croſs and the crown kiſs each other. And to ſet you right that ſeek after, and contend for this crown,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Underſtand what this crown of life is. It is not only the tranſlation of the ſoul after death into the ſupernal heavens, that is not ſo properly called life; but that bleſſed ſtate which ſoul and body ſhall enjoy after the reſurrection of the juſt, and therefore it is called a crown of life; that is, life given moſt eminently, which is the moſt deſirable bleſſing of all things, as being one of the chiefeſt gifts of the bleſſed Saints in the reſurrection, and ſo part is put for the whole; and therefore it is here called <hi>a Crown of life:</hi> To denote unto us, firſt, That that bleſſed ſtate of life which the Saints ſhall then enjoy, will be a moſt honourable ſtate, and ſo it is often ſet forth by a kingdom in Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.29.12.32. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. Secondly, That it is an endleſs eſtate. Thirdly, That it is a ſtate gotten by conqueſt, and as a prize ſet unto a race, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. Fourthly, That it is a moſt glorious eſtate, and a living crown, and that that will continue to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the next place, underſtand how this crown of eternal life is rightly to be obtained; every ſuffering will not do it: The cauſe muſt be good that makes a Martyr, it muſt be for Chriſt, and that in faithfulneſs. Secondly, The heart muſt be upright for Chriſt therein: It is not vain-glory, or worldly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, or obſtinacy in private opinions, that will weigh the leaſt to make a Martyr; it muſt be in the uprightneſs of your hearts, and that you can appeal unto God with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.21. and ſay, <hi>The Lord knoweth the ſecrets of the heart, Yea, for thy ſake are we ſlain all the day long.</hi> Laſtly, This ſuffering muſt be out of love unto God and his glory, or elſe all in vain, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>If I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.</hi> There may many die for Chriſt, and yet not out of love to Chriſt; obſtinacy of mind, and formal profeſſion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53073:98"/>
may do much in that particular; but a true zeal to God and his glory, makes the <hi>Holocoſt,</hi> a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice, and the crown of life its reward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The laſt Obſervation from theſe words, is, <hi>Sufferings and afflictions are but the opening the door to a Chriſtians happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt happy eſtate of the worldling, is but vanity; and the moſt ſuffering ſtate of a chriſtian, is a crowning: when the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſuffereth the loſs of all things for righteouſneſs ſake, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth then in greater meaſure of graces; yea, when he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death it ſelf, it is gain unto him; for he hath only left thereby a world of troubles, ſin, and vanities, for a crown or life and glory: <hi>For, if our hopes were only in this life, we were of all men moſt miſerable:</hi> Therefore <hi>be thou faithful unto the death, and thou ſhalt have a crown of life.</hi>

But, <hi>he that overcometh,</hi> that is, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth conſtant and faithful unto Chriſt and his truths under all temptations and tribulations, and ſo a faithful chriſtian overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is he that ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death; that is, the ſecond death mentioned in 21 <hi>chap. Rev. ver.</hi> 8. and 20.14. In that Lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone for evermore, ſhall not touch him. Negatives in Scripture ſtrongly evince the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the contrary; as, Thou ſhalt not be hurt of the ſecond death; that is, thou ſhalt ſurely live, thou ſhalt taſte of the Tree of life in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, and a crown of life ſhall be thy portion. It is here called the ſecond death, in reſpect the firſt death is but a partial puniſhment of the wicked; but the ſecond death is, that when the firſt death and hell ſhall deliver up the dead were in them, and they ſhall be caſt into the Lake of fire, <hi>cap.</hi> 20. 13, 14. there is a firſt life, and a ſecond life that we ſhall enjoy; the firſt life is that that we now at preſent enjoy; the life of grace, the ſecond life, we ſhall be made partakers of at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the juſt. The life that the ſoul in heaven enjoys, is but a partial life, and incompleat, in reſpect of that at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; as the puniſhment of the wicked under the firſt death, either ſpiritual or corporal, is but partial, ſo the glory of the elect is but partial and incompleat now in heaven, in reſpect of that that will be revealed at the reſurrection. <hi>Abraham</hi> now doth not know us, and <hi>Jacob</hi> is ignorant of us, neither do the faints departed know

So then, there is a firſt death, and a ſecond death; the firſt death is but a partial puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the wicked, but the ſecond death is the compleat execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine wrath upon them, in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone for evermore.</p>

                  <p>To afflicted and perſecuted faithful churches, as <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> were, he appears as a God of protection and ſalvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as in the firſt verſe, under the deſcription of having the ſeven Stars in his right hand, and walking in the midſt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Golden candleſticks; and in the eighth verſe he ſaith to the church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> for a comfortable diſcovery unto them, <hi>write, theſe things, ſaith he, that is first and laſt, which was dead and is alive.</hi> But now unto the more unſound and corrupted churches of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> his diſcovery is in another poſture, as one <hi>having a two edged ſword proceeding from his mouth, and eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like fine braſs, v.</hi> 18. an appearance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, Wrath and Judgment. Faithful afflicted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians need diſcoveries of grace, peace, and conſolation, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and corrupt ones, ought to have the doctrine of Judgments and wrath preach'd unto them; he that knoweth not rightly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the words of truth, is no compleat workman in Chriſt's Vineyard, he is a workman that need not be aſhamed, that knows how to preach Goſpel, and glad tidings of reconciliation and peace, to poor humbled and repentant ſinners; But Hell, and wrath, and judgments, and fiery indignations, to the obſtinate and impenitent, the doctrine of grace and threats are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictories, being wiſely managed; yet in this appearance of Chriſt of having a ſharp two edged ſword proceeding out of his mouth, there is much mercy in it; for underſtand, that by the ſword of Chriſt's mouth is meant his word and doctrine: confer with <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.6. and 56.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.4. for that is two edged, and cuts two ways. Firſt, it cuts off the ſin and corruptions of the faithful, by its kindly operating through the influence of the Spirit. Secondly, It cuts, confounds, and deſtroys the wicked, not through any innate quality in the Word, but by accident; for by their refuſal and contempt thereof, ſo conſequently of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, the Author and Inſtituter thereof, God goes out with the other edg or ſide of his ſword againſt them, on his black and red horſe of wrath and Judgments. Hence Note,</p>

                  <p>Though Chriſt's appearance to <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> was much in wrath, for their defilements and back-ſlidings, yet he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much grace and mercy thereunto, both in approbation of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53073:99"/>
their graces, and calling them to repentance for their defections. Chriſt gives always line upon line, and precept upon precept; providence after providence, and mercy after mercy, to invite us to repentance, before he will take his laſt cauſe of Judgment with us; his heart is ſtill towards our amendment, though he is provoked highly by our ſins againſt us; and who but an heart of Adamant would not believe him, when he ſwears, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, I will not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn and live?</hi> And the very weapons that he uſes againſt ſinners, are the ſword of his mouth with two edges; it heals as well as wounds: the one edge is anointed with the balm of Grace, though the other with the gall of Judgment.</p>

Therefore theſe metaphors of a Throne, Seat, Houſe, or Habitation, are fitly taken up by the Spirit of God, to ſignifie unto us the power of Satan in the wicked and ungodly, which in Scriptures, are called his ſtrong holds and habitations; for in them he commands and acts freely, being as a Father, Lord, and Maſter, to us the children of diſobedience; for his ſervants and children ye are to whom ye obey, and they obey freely and without any regret as dutiful children and ſervants to ſuch a Father and Maſter, even the Prince that ruleth in the Ayre, even the Spirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. there he makes his habitation, there he lives and tranſacts the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of his Kingdom of darkneſs, there he takes his delight to dwell, and takes that pleaſure in this place of his habitation, that before he will forego it, or loſe an inch of his poſſeſſion, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er man in the Goſpel muſt firſt come, even Chriſt in his Spirit of Grace, and that after much ſtrugling &amp; contending between fleſh and ſpirit; and that Chriſt ſhall be ſure to make his Title clear and evident by Faith, and the great charter of the Goſpel, before he will be diſpoſſeſſed of his ancient free-hold Tenures; yea his love, or rather pernitious deſire to his old habitation, is ſuch, that after he is diſpoſſeſſed thereof by Chriſt, that if he can get or make a re-entry into his loſt poſſeſſion, by his diabolical Stratagems and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, he comes in with ſeven fold worſer ſpirits then the firſt, to make good his right and re-entry, if he may, and the condition of that houſe is far more miſerable then at the firſt. O therefore watch, and be prepared with the armory of Chriſt to oppoſe the aſſaults of Satan, ye believing and enlightened ſouls! and though he ſometimes may foyl you, yet let him not overturn you; though he may endeavour to come into your ſoul, yet let him not have quiet poſſeſſion; for <hi>greater is he that is with us, then he that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, Reſiſt the Divel, and he will flee from you:</hi> and, <hi>through Chriſt we ſhall have Victory</hi> Note hence,</p>
                  <p>Obſerve, <hi>That Satan rules as abſolute Lord and Soveraign over the unbelieving and diſobedient.</hi> They are his houſe, the place of his dwelling, his Throne, his Kingdom, his Seat; and if that were not enough to deſcribe their malignity, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Soveraignty over them, they are called Satan himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 10. The better to manifeſt Satan's Seat, Throne, and Habitation, in and over the ungodly: conſider the contrary, The Seat, Throne and Habitation of God. Though God in his infinite nature, is illocal, infinite, and incomprehenſible, as unto any place or form, yet metaphorically is ſaid to be in a place, that is, from whence he in any ſpecial manner doth manifeſt his glory, power, grace, and goodneſs: So God is ſaid to come, depart, and return, in Scriptures, when he ſpecially manifeſts himſelf in grace, mercy,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53073:100"/>
and anſwers to his people, or unto any particular believing Soul; and when God withdraws that appearance of mercy, grace, and glory, nor hears the Prayers of his people, but goes out in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt them, then he is ſaid to depart, to be gone, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his place. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledg their Offence.</hi> God is ſaid to have three ſpecial places of habitation, Seats or Thrones in Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Heaven is his Throne, and his dwelling place. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.30.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The hearts of the Saints is his Throne, and dwelling place. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Church or Chriſt; <hi>Zion is the habitation and Tabernacle of his glory. Pſal.</hi> 132.13. The Church is the place where God communicates himſelf, and gives his anſwers unto his people. And therefore in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. it is called <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> and often in Scriptures, <hi>the Kingdom of God.</hi> Theſe are the ſpecial habitations of God.</p>
                  <p>Satan hath alſo three ſpecial places of habitation and dominion in Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Hell over the damned ſpirits: And therefore he is called the Prince of darkneſs, and the Angel of the bottomleſs Pit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The hearts of the wicked and unbelievers, is the Seat and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of Satan. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His Throne is amongſt the ſocieties of the wicked; they are his Synagogue, <hi>v.</hi> 9. where his Doctrines are tranſacted and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and they are his Seat and Throne, from whence all his wicked and pernitious Edicts do proceed againſt God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2, 3.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in this verſe, the Spirit ſayes to the Church of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus, I know that thou dwelleſt in a place where Satan bears rule in all Idolatries, wickedneſſes, and hatred to God and his truths with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controulment; and yet, to thy praiſe and comfort be it, that thou holdeſt faſt my Name, and hast not denied my Faith;</hi> that is, that thou doſt conſtantly profeſs my Truth, and haſt not been drawn to deny my Goſpel, or Doctrine of Faith, not in thoſe very hot and perſecuting days, wherein <hi>Antipas,</hi> my faithful Martyr, was ſlain in that City of yours, by thoſe Tyranical perſons there, in whom Satan dwelleth, and prevaileth. There is no farther difficulty in thoſe words; only underſtand that <hi>Antipas,</hi> as <hi>Aretus</hi> teſtifies, and ſome others of Antiquitie, was the Paſtor or Biſhop to this Church of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> yet others ſay, he was only an Aſſiſtant to the Church: However, this bleſſed St. <hi>Antipas, Policarpus,</hi> and ſome others, were the firſt Martyrs to the Goſpel of Chriſt after the Apoſtles, in the raign of <hi>Trajan.</hi> From the words thus explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Note,</p>

Church of Chriſt is likened to a Lilly amongſt Thorns, by the Wiſe-man in the <hi>Canticles:</hi> Where the Synagogue and Throne of Satan was, God had planted thoſe Aſiatick Churches.

for their ſupport and comfort, <hi>Thou remembreſt us</hi> (ſaid David) <hi>in our low eſtate.</hi> Where Chriſt's Church hath the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, God will ſhew himſelf their greateſt friend; where his Saints are moſt afflicted and ſtraitned, there he will ſupply with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er meaſure of grace and enlargement. In <hi>Babylon</hi> of old, among the inveterate enemies of God and his Iſrael, God ſent an <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel, Daniel, Ezra,</hi> &amp;c. choice men, and Prophets of God, for their comfort and conſolation. So we often ſee in the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and wicked places of the World, that God ſends there the greateſt, ſoundeſt, and cleareſt light to his ſervants that dwels amongſt them; <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Pergamus, &amp;c.</hi> places of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and cruelty, and where Satan's ſeat was, had their Angels, and Martyrs, that ſhined in true faith and godlineſs. The Churches of Chriſt of late years have ſhined more eminent in faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the barbarous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Pyrenean mountains, and <hi>Alpes,</hi> then other places of the World; and ſo in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and perſecuting Biſhops of late, the Saints then living under them, did ſhine more eminent in their graces, then now they do in this their day of proſperity; and many then were more faithful Martyrs unto the truth of Chriſt, then now they are: for the more high Satan and his inſtruments are againſt the Saints, God's care over them is the more intenſe, and the meaſure of his graces the more enlarged towards them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. <hi>That it is the Saints great duty, and their highest glory, to hold faſt their faith and profeſsion of the truth, in the worſt times, and amongſt the worſt of people.</hi> The Church at <hi>Pergamus</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for holding faſt Chriſt's Name and Faith, amongſt them in whom Satan did bear ſway, and in ſuch a time when <hi>Antipas</hi> was Martyred, and ſuffered death for the ſame profeſſion. It is an eaſy matter to carry a full ſail of profeſſion, when the ſoft gale of proſperity bloweth; neither is it any difficult matter for an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical heart to ſeem godly with the godly, to be ſober with the ſober, or to be righteous amongſt the righteous: But the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man is then tried, when his habitation is amongſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, that can keep himſelf ſound amongſt their corruptions, upright and perfect amongſt the unrighteous, and untainted with their follies, and ſweet, as Fiſhes in the Brackiſh Ocean. The three faithful children would not bow in <hi>Babylon,</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, though death it ſelf attended them: <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death, and thou ſhalt have a Crown of life.</hi> Many will follow Chriſt in ſmiling times, or when the State does countenance Chriſt and godlineſs; this is to follow Chriſt for the loaves ſake: But when Chriſt is hurried to <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Hall of Judgment, his formal followers will forſake him, yea, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf may deny him; weak Chriſtians may ſtumble and draw back, when Pillars of the Church, as <hi>Peter,</hi> fall ſo fouly. He is the only approved Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53073:102"/>
that will hold his profeſſion faſt before the face of <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as the <hi>virum victoriae</hi> which St. <hi>Austin</hi> mentions, and at the Stake, can freely with <hi>Stephen,</hi> forgive his enemies, and commend his ſpirit unto his God. <hi>Jo: Hus, Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> the poor <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and our later Chriſtian Martyrs, as <hi>Bradford, Philpot, Glover,</hi> &amp;c. in our Engliſh <hi>Marian</hi> days, hath with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipas,</hi> for their conſtant witneſſing unto the truth and faith of Chriſt, attained the ever-living and honorable names of faithful Martyrs of Chriſt, and that moſt juſtly, in that they ſuffered in the worſt of times, when <hi>Antipas</hi> was ſlain, that is, in a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bloody age, when many godly perſons burnt at the Stake, and amongſt the worſt ſort of people, the wicked Antichriſtian, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranizing, and bloody Prelates, for holding faſt the profeſſion of the truth and faith, in ſuch ungodly times, and amongſt ſuch a diveliſh crew, amongſt whom Satan had his Throne, ſway, and full Dominion, they juſtly ſhall ever live, in the memory and hearts of all the faithful, as Reverend Martyrs unto Chriſt and his truth. Thus for a man to be a <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> never touched with <hi>Sodom</hi>'s wickedneſs, to keep himſelf pure, and ſincere, and undefiled in the midſt of a crooked generation, to ſhine as a light in the midſt of darkneſs, this brings honor both to God and man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 6. <hi>The graces of well approved and faithful Chriſtians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, are to be ſet forth as patterns and examples to the living, both for encouragement and imitation. Antipas</hi> is here ſet as an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conſtancy and faithful Martyrdom unto Chriſt and his truth. It is great encouragement to the living, to have the pattern of former worthy men before them. It is ſaid, that it was the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Achilles</hi> life in <hi>Homer,</hi> that made <hi>Alexander</hi> ambitious to be his competitor in noble atchievments. Again <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> taking up <hi>Alexander</hi>'s example, endeavoured to be ſole Lord of the whole World. So alſo it is on a ſpiritual account; <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the Father of the faithful, for his approved faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, and they are his children, and the true ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that walk in the ſteps of faithful <hi>Abraham:</hi> And ſo <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Sarah, Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> are made ever-liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examples of faith and godlines, for imitation to all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. It much comforts us and bears up our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in ſufferings, when we hear that Chriſt our head and captain hath perfected our ſalvation by ſufferings, he having trodden to us our firſt this thorny way, let us not be aſhamed to take up our croſs and follow him, whenſoever he ſhall call us to it; and ſo in all things elſe in him, that are imitable by us, not as he was Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but as a holy perſon, and head of his myſtical body, the Church; and ſo he preſents himſelf as a gracious example to his Diſciples, <hi>Jo.</hi> 13.15. <hi>For I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi> As he is the perfection of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the light it ſelf, and wiſdom of the Father, ſo ſure o

                  <p>The churches of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> only of the whole ſeven, did paſs the approbation of the Spirit without any <hi>but</hi> prefixed, or annexed to them: The church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> had her commendable graces, of conſtancy in the faith, and profeſſion of the truth, in the worſt of times, and amongſt the vileſt people, even where the Seat of Satan was: Yet all in her is not well, or ſound, for Chriſt comes on with a <hi>but</hi> againſt her; <hi>But I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe, &amp;c.</hi> Whence by the way, Obſerve,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs the church at <hi>Pergamus</hi> had and enjoyed but ſad and afflicting days, when <hi>Antipas</hi> Chriſt's faithful Martyr was ſlayn, for then ſhe denied not the faith, but held her profeſſion with much conſtancy. The church at <hi>Thyatira</hi> too, was commended for her faith and her patience, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. yet both theſe churches, notwithſtanding their fair profeſſion, they had much rottenneſs and unſoundneſs in the root; their Doctrines were not ſtrait that they had among them, there were thoſe in the one, held the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the doctrines of the <hi>Niolaitans;</hi> in the other, the doctrines of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and her wicked practiſes; both moſt unſound both in doctrine and practiſe, yet both highly ſuffering for the Name of Chriſt. We ſee that the profeſſion of the Name of Chriſt amongſt the Gentiles, was ſufficient to bring ſuffering on the Diſciples, but ſuffering for that profeſſion was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make them ſound in all things.

                  <p>But to proceed, Chriſt hath a charge againſt this church of Pergamus, and it is, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt there them that hold the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Balaam, who taught Balack to caſt a ſtumbling block, or a ſtone of offence</hi> (in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And what haſt thou? Thoſe that hold the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> &amp;c. the doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> was, when he ſaw that God had bleſſed <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that there was no Inchantment againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly adviſed <hi>Balack</hi> the Prince of the Midianites, to make a great Sacrifice to <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> and to invite the Iſraelites unto it: Now <hi>Baal Peor</hi> was the filthy, laſcivious Idol <hi>Priapus,</hi> as <hi>Godwin</hi>'s Jewiſh Antiquities teſtifie; whoſe Feſtivals and Sacrifices were celebrated by both Sexes, in moſt ſhameleſs poſtures and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And therefore, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.10. It is ſaid, <hi>they went to</hi> Baal Peor, <hi>and diſcovered themſelves to their ſhame,</hi> becauſe it made them ſhameleſs, and to diſcover their nakedneſs before that Idol. Now the curſed advice or doctrine of <hi>Balaam</hi> (for a man's doctrine is his advice or counſel) conſiſteth of two parts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To ſacrifice to Idols, and to participate at their curſed Altars, in eating of their idolothites, expreſly againſt the Law of God, and that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 28, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.29.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In mixing with the Midianitiſh women, a notion ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forbidden to the Jewiſh Nation, not to meddle with in ſuch a way. So that though <hi>Balaam</hi> could not curſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to <hi>Balack</hi>'s deſires being overmaſtered by God; yet it ſeems his heart went ſtill after the wages of unrighteouſneſs, as, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. teſtifies; that is, his deſires and heart was to take <hi>Balack</hi>'s hire and reward to curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if the Lord had not overmaſtered both his tongue and heart, and inſtead of curſing them, he was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bleſs them; and ſeeing he could not pleaſure <hi>Balack</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his expectation and deſires, as a Prophet in his maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he was free, as a private <hi>Machavilian,</hi> or an <hi>Achitophel,</hi> to counſel <hi>Balack,</hi> that the readieſt way to bring the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> at enmity with their God, was to bring them to Idolatry and Adultery; and ſo God that was their keeper and Saviour againſt all enchantments and curſings, would become their enemy, and deliver them up either to <hi>Balack</hi>'s, or the Moabites hands, or ſmite them himſelf in wrath and judgment. And indeed <hi>Balaam</hi>'s deſire and doctrine took effect, and was right unto its end; and

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53073:104"/>
brethren, then ſome of them were ſo bold and impudent, as to come before them, even in their faces, with their ſins in their hands, not aſhamed of them. Sober Chriſtians will think it ſtrange, that any profeſſed churches of Chriſt, or Chriſtians, ſhould openly, and profeſſedly, hold and maintain Doctrines &amp; practiſes as bad as <hi>Balaam</hi>'s and the Nicholaitans, and if not far worſe: And yet this carries as much truth with it, as any Hiſtorical relation in the World; and that too, maintained with as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſneſs, impudency, ſtrength of wit, and policy, as if it were the moſt virtuous or gracious principle in the whole word of God. What a doing, tugging, and patching of counſels there was, for the upholding of Idolatry and Image worſhip in the church of <hi>Rome</hi> for many ages? All were Anathematiz'd by her, that would not joyn in that falſe worſhip; and it is to this day maintained by them, in the face of the Sun, which is the great ſcandal and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to the Jews and Turks, to keep them off from the faith unto this day. O moſt ſad! that profeſſed chriſtians ſhould be the greateſt and moſt obſtinate Idolaters amongſt the Nations round about them: And this is not all, they have their adulteries too, and fornications, profeſſedly owned, avowed, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; elſe what meaneth the publique Revenues that cometh into the Pope's Coffers from the Stews at <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſewhere, under his Juriſdiction, which were authorized and erected by <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth at <hi>Rome:</hi> And Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, that prohibited the Clergy Marriage, deprived a Prieſt of his benefice at <hi>Placentia,</hi> for having a wife and children; but the ſaid Prieſt, afterward prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid woman to be the wife of another man, and only his concubine, he was again reſtored. O abominable! and doctrine of devils! honorable Marriage forbidden, and Adultery, and Fornication, allowed and countenanced! And this is not a private opinion, or of ſome perſons in that harlot church; but it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of <hi>Pergamus:</hi> for they had but ſome amongſt them that held the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> but it is here more general; &amp; as catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as their church is, ſo catholick are thoſe their errors &amp; wicked practiſes; for as far as the church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Juriſdiction reach esſo far the worſhip of Images, her Idolatries &amp; adulteries reach alſo. But let us turn our eye from this great Scarlet Whore, and look a little, and reflect upon our own reformed churches at home, and ſee whether there is any thing there maintained and upheld as the Doctrines of <hi>Balaam</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> amongſt us: It is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to enquire, an enemy diſcovered is half vanquiſhed. I hope we have but few of the late generation of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts left among us, of that prelatical party, that endeavour'd with might and main to bring in the doctrines of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and of their aboveſaid mother <hi>Jezabel,</hi> amongſt us. 'Tis true, they endeavour'd to lay a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block before the true Iſraelites of God in their travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> they enticed and invited the faithful

ones of this Nation to the Sacrifices of <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> and to commit Fornication with the Midianitiſh women; and many precious ones did ſtumble and fall thereby: but God gave them a day of ſorrow and repentance for it. Now their Idolatries and Adulteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their Altar worſhips; pompous gorgious Services, crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and congies at the croſs, Muſical church-ſervices, &amp;c. all which are but part of the garment of the Scarlet whore; but alſo they commited Fornication with the daughters of <hi>Moab;</hi> that is, they mixed Intereſt and relation with Antichriſtians, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed counſels with Jeſuites, &amp;c. and took up profeſſedly Romiſh principles and practiſes; As the doctrine of free-will, liberty of plays on the Lord's day, and conformity to all outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial rites and ſervices, on purpoſe to enſnare the conſcientious and godly, and to make them fall: And yet this was not all, but like true Balaamites, they taught <hi>Balack</hi> to lay a ſtumbling block before the children of Iſrael; that is, they incited and ſtirred up their Prince and Soveraign to do the very ſame, and to enact heavy and penal Laws againſt all Non-conformiſts, to their forms and falſe worſhips, and received from <hi>Balack</hi> their foe, the wages or hyre of unrighteouſneſs: It is not he that preaches the Goſpel and lives by the Goſpel, that receives the wages of <hi>Balaam,</hi> as ſome Fanatiques of theſe days would have it, but very ſutably it maybe applied to ſuch Prophets that will teach their Prince and Soveraign to ſet up and command a worſhip which hath none of Chriſt's ſtamp upon it, and to enforce it on the conſciences of the truly godly, on great penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thereby to inſnare them, and make them ſtumble, if they may: Theſe are true Balaamites indeed, and for this their Antichriſtian ſervice, they expect great revenues, encouragements, and honors, as wages due unto them, and this is the wages of unrighteouſneſs; 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.15. which <hi>Balaam</hi> loved. There is another ſort amongſt us, that hold profeſſedly the doctrine of the Nicholaitans and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam;</hi> that hold no difference betwoeen good and evil, and that good and evil conſiſts only in opinion, not in reality; and theſe are high flown Anti-Scripturiſts, and Antinomeſtical Atheiſts, and are not ſo much as to be converſed with as chriſtians, but to be looked on as aliens and ſtrangers to God, his Laws, and the Commonweale of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Lord open their eyes to ſee their madneſs and folly, if it be his bleſſed will.</p>

of their former ſacrifices of divels, and their idolathites, and of Chriſt's Table alſo; but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was very bitter againſt ſuch, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.20, 21. and the Spirit here alſo falls foul upon them, and ſets a check upon the Pergamitiſh church for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch doctrines: What ado had <hi>Paul</hi> alſo to take off the believing Jews from their circumciſion and Moſaical rites; they would needs have the obſervation of all the ceremonial Law, and paedagogy of <hi>Moſes</hi> joyned to Chriſt for juſtification, and ſo make Chriſt of none effect: no leſs then a full council of Apoſtles and Elders were ſufficient to remove this ſtumbling block out of the way, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and what a difficult buſineſs it was in the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to reform up fully, all the world knows; what up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars, commotions, and civil wars there were in K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth's days, when the Maſs-book was but turned into Engliſh, as ſome of K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s counſellors adviſed our Corniſh Rebels, who were then in Arms for their old <hi>Mumpſimus,</hi> and Popiſh worſhip?

What ſhall us deſire more on our own parts? Or, what greater bleſſing can we expect from God by the ſword of the Magiſtrate then to be protected, ſecured, and countenanced in the ways and worſhip of God according to a good conſcience? If the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Churches will not reform in ſuch a day when publique Edicts are gone forth from <hi>Cyrus</hi> to ſet <hi>Iſrael</hi> free, I wonder when
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53073:108"/>
they will fall upon it? Do they expect the Magiſtrate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and compel all unto the work? Alas, this is not the generation that all will be fit for ſuch a work in a whole Nation or Kingdom; no, never will there be ſuch a golden age, until Chriſt himſelf ſhall come with the fan in his hand, to purge his garner, and take the Kingdom unto himſelf. Is not the church a Lilly among thorns? If the whole Nation be the church, where are the thorns? Are they the other neighbour Nations about? Alas, they are Lillies too; churches (on that account) as well as you: Are they the gentle Nations, as, Turks, Perſians, Antichriſtians, and Popiſh Nations? As Italians, Spaniſh, French, &amp;c? Alas they are no Thorns to you; the reformed Nations are in equal ballance to them, and as apt to hear them, as they you; But I confeſs you have thoſe chriſtian ſocieties and churches among you, that are as Lillies ſhining in graces among thoſe Thorns and unfruitful Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and to retard our reformation in church and ordinances, till all be ſquared and hewn fit for this work, or before the Magiſtrate compels all unto this work, is a vain expectation, ſeeing that there is ſo much of that old leven of our anceſtors, National Churches, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Officers, Birth priviledges and Ordinances on that account &amp;c. ſtill remaining in the hearts of moſt amongſt us; that it will not only render the work of a full reformation in this generation, moſt difficult, but the attempt thereof rather dangerous and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, not only to the faithful in this Land, but generally to the cauſe of Chriſt, in all the reformed Nations round about us. Witneſs the intemperate zeale of many that lived in the days of the firſt reformation; who became a reproach and a ſhame in their irregular attempts about this work: Though they had good hearts, and deſired and aimed at good and juſt things; yet they proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it not juſtly, for to denominate a good action or work. The thing it ſelf deſired and attempted, muſt not only be a good and honeſt thing in it ſelf, as a full reformation to God's word is; but it muſt have other honeſt circumſtances in it alſo.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 The manner how muſt be conſidered, in a peaceable maner, it is to be endeavoured and promoted, as the work of the ſpirit of peace; not with wars, tumults, and rebellions againſt Magiſtrates, which is as the ſin of witchcraft: So that the beſt action may loſe its reward, and the atempters thereof ſuffer juſtly for the unjuſt proſecution thereof. It is a ſure rule to chriſtians, that they are to do no evil, that good may come thereof. We are not to ſin againſt the Laws of God, nor his Ordinance of Magiſtracy (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs caſes of inevitable neceſſity, where God will rather have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy then Sacrifice) to promote any juſt end or good whatſoever; for we are bound to walk by the rule of God's commands and precepts, not of events and providences. Therefore all ye faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53073:108"/>
ones of this land, be wiſe and ſober in this your way of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſtop not the current of God's reformation by your preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate and irregular actings, be you ſtill and you ſhall ſee the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our God: You ſee the main hinderance of this full work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, even the old leven of falſe worſhips derived and left unto us from our anceſtors; God will remove this more and more by ſteps and degrees, and that more generally, and will enlarge the Tents of <hi>Jacob</hi> among us, if we provoke not God by our ſins towards him: But to expect a total reformation, never look for it until the day Star ſhall ariſe with an incomparable glory. In the interim, let us walk honeſtly, and ſoberly, like children of the Light, ſerving and fearing God, and honoring the King; and then God will make them unto us Nurſing Fathers, and Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Mothers. And moſt happy and bleſſed are the people that have their portion and lot in ſuch a Land.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> But after all this an Objection may be riſen. The church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> had thoſe among them that held and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the doctrines of <hi>Balaam</hi> and the Nicolaitans, and practiſed ſpiritual and corporal adulteries; ſo held the church of <hi>Corinth. Thyatira</hi> had the doctrines of <hi>Jezabel, Galathia</hi> the Jewiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of circumciſion, and many other great corruptions were among thoſe primitive churches; as, drunkenneſs, denying the reſurrection, inceſt, eating things offered unto Idols, and the obſcenity of the Nicolaitans: Yet theſe are ſtill called the churches of Chriſt, his ſeven candleſticks, his faithful ones, called and elect. And are not then our Parochial churches, our National churches, as truly churches of Chriſt as thoſe were? And are they not as ſound in doctrine and practiſes, as thoſe firſt primitive chriſtians and churches were, and ſo deſerve the Name of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, faithful, elect and called as well as they?</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I Anſwer, We are to look unto the firſt inſtitution of all churches; if they are gathered and planted by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel and Spirit, they are truly churches of Chriſt, elect and called; though in proceſs of time, the envious one ſowed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully among the good Wheat, his Tares and Darnel, as among thoſe of <hi>Corinth, Pergamus</hi> and others in the Primitive time; yet I believe Chriſt had but a few things againſt theirs, in reſpect what he has againſt ours; they were but corrupt in part, ours all leprous; they loſt but ſome members, we the very vitals: For I much queſtion, whether our National churches were of this Goſpel ſtructure, as thoſe primitive churches were at the firſt, ſeeing we read in Hiſtory of their civill inſtitution and beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo divided or ordained by the politique Laws of the Nation: Yet withall I ſay, we had the ſincere faith of Chriſt here preach'd amongſt us preſently after, if not in the very Apoſtles days, by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> as Hiſtorians teſtifie; this good ſeed was almoſt loſt among us, but again revived by the providence of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53073:109"/>
God in after ages, but held captive and low under the Tyranny of Antichriſtian darkneſs, yet doubtleſs God had here and elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where his inviſible church and elect ones. Our ſucceſſion to the Apoſtles is by cleaving to their doctrines, and ſo we own a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from them, but not a viſible ſucceſſion of churches, for ſo we have ſayled under the Antichriſts raign and tyranny over us: and to plead that our parochial Societies are churches of Chriſt, is but at beſt to plead that our Hundreds or Counties are church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſions, Presbyteries, or Eccleſiaſtique Juriſdictions, alſo being of the ſame civil inſtitution with the former. But ſome write that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was the firſt divider and inſtitutor of Pariſhes about <hi>Anno</hi> 267. and brought into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Honorius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as learned Maſter <hi>Selden</hi> in his Book <hi>de Decimis</hi> teſtifies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I Anſwer, If our churches were right in their firſt inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on gathered by the word and ſpirit, we have as really loſt the very being of our churches under Antichriſt's raign, as the churches of <hi>Corinth, Pergamus, Epheſus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. under the Saracenical tyranny and Mahometaniſm: And therefore there is as great need to call our churches out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to reſtore them from Antichriſtianiſme, as <hi>Pergamus</hi> &amp;c. of the miſerable captivated Aſian churches from Turciſm, and Mahometaniſm; unleſs we grant, that the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> had the keeping and was the preſerver of the Ordinances of the true Spouſe, and had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Keys committed unto her: And therefore the authority that many churches pretend unto by ſucceſſion of churches, is but a ſorry one, and at the beſt, but Antichriſtian and Popiſh.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I Anſwer, That it is not corruptions in a church do nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie a church, though very high, if right and ſound in the root, and hold faſt the faith. This gives the very being to a church; and ſo I ſay, that many of our National churches, having now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonunced their inſtitutions and calls from Antichriſt, and being called to the fellowſhip of the faith by the miniſtry of the word and ſpirit, are become Spouſes of Chriſt, called, and faithful, though mixed with many corruptions, and unſound Doctrines and practiſes, as <hi>Pergamus, Corinth,</hi> and others were; yet for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith and Sacraments amongſt them, are to be accounted as golden candleſticks of the Lord, churches of Chriſt, holy, and ſanctified: But ſtill obſerve this, that the church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the more pure and undefiled one, hath the greater praiſe, greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of love, grace, comfort, and glory on her, then any of the others the more unſound ones; though they be Siſters, yet this is the only one of her Mother; though all the reſt be Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters yet this is the Roſe of <hi>Sharon,</hi> and the Lilly of the Valleys; though the reſt are Chriſt's Vineyards too, yet this is the Garden incloſed, where he takes his delight at Noon.

                  <p>Firſt, He manages it (as light to diſcover darkneſs) by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Miniſters, both for the evincing, confounding, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing all falſe worſhips, doctrines and practiſes: And thus he manifeſts his diſpleaſure from Heaven, by his Word, againſt all workers of iniquity, as he does here, againſt the Balaamitiſh, and Nicolaiſh doctrines of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and as he hath done of late amongſt us, againſt all Popiſh and Superſtitious Innovations, and falſe worſhips.</p>
                  <p>But, Secondly, If the miniſterial convincing word will not ſerve to re-call and bring to repentance his rebellious people or enemies, he will proceed farther by his terrible doctrine or words of judgment againſt them. If <hi>Pergamus</hi> will not repent upon the conviction of her ſins, Chriſt will go out and fight againſt her, and remove her candleſtick from amongſt her; yea, God will call for a <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> a <hi>Mahomet,</hi> an <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and they ſhall be called his ſervants, to execute the Lord's commands, and burthens of Judgment, againſt his rebellious ſinful chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: And thus Chriſt's ſword of his mouth is to be underſtood, with which he fights againſt his enemies, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.21. Thus <hi>the remnant of the followers of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, were ſlain with the ſword of him that ſate upon the Horſe, which ſword proceedeth out of his mouth;</hi> that is, (as honeſt Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> on the place ſays) <hi>they were ſlain by the powerful command of Chriſt,</hi> (not only Spiritually or Analogically, but corporally) <hi>and upon their bodily death all the fowles were filled with their fleſh:</hi> thus far Biſhop <hi>Hall.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to take <hi>the children of</hi> Babel <hi>and to daſh them againſt the wall.

Thus we ſee what is the ſword of Chriſt's mouth that he draws againſt his unrepentant and obſtinate wicked churches; firſt confuſion of their falſe doctrines, by his powerful miniſterial word and ſpirit.

But by the way take a character of true penitents.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They abhor themſelves in their own eyes; the ſight of their ſins makes them to abhor and loath themſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43. and <hi>Job,</hi> 42.6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This they doe not ſo much for the evil that ſin brings upon them, as for the evil it ſelf which is in ſin; being an offence againſt God, and his Divine Will and holy Laws. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Their repentance is univerſal and perfect, as to its parts; it is not one ſin or corruption they leave, but all: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.43. <hi>Ye ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for all the evils that you have committed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:53073:110"/>Fourthly, They are afterwards the more jealous of God's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and fearful to ſin againſt him, ſaying, <hi>How ſhall we doe this thing, and ſin againſt our God?</hi> Who hath waſhed us, and cleanſed us, and ſanctified us: How ſhall we defile our ſelves again by ſin, leſt our ſtate become ſeven fold worſe then the firſt? This is the temper of a gracious repentant Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>God is ſo gracious that he always premoniſheth, before he ſtrikes in judgment his rebellious and ſinful people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He calls them to repentance before he will go forth to fight with the ſword of his mouth againſt them: He will not come in wrath upon them unwarned. If God hath decreed a general deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or deſolation to any churches, he will make it known unto his Prophets, they ſhall declare it to his people: And therefore ſo often here in theſe two chapters Chriſt ſays, <hi>Let him that hath an eare hear what the ſpirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi> Let him that is wiſe among you conſider well of thoſe Judgments which are to come upon you, and are made known unto you by your Prophet <hi>John;</hi> And to what end doth God this?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Lords Elect and precious ones among them may be awakened out of their ſins, and brought to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That they may be ſecured from eternal ruine, if not from temporal.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the wicked and impenitent may acknowledge their own evil ways, and give glory to God, and juſtifie God's righteous proceedings againſt them: Yea often God will premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a long time, and bear long with the ſins of his people, before he will execute the puniſhment due unto them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.5. God could in a moment cruſh them all with his breath, yet waits long for their repentance, 390. years, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about 100 years, <hi>in the days of</hi> Noah <hi>whilſt the Ark was a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> God's long-ſuffering waited for the repentance of the old world, by the Preaching of <hi>Noah</hi> unto them: How long did God premoniſh us ſince the firſt time of the firſt reformation, by his faithful Prophets and Miniſters, to purge and caſt out the leaven of Antichriſtianiſm from among us, before he would go out in Judgment againſt us; was not his long-ſuffering exerciſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us from <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and <hi>Edward</hi> 6. days, unto theſe preſent times, a hundred years and upward, ſtill looking and expecting that we would pull down the High places and Groves that <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> built, and the Prieſts of Baal in the confines of our holy Land; and this was the Lord's long-ſuffering to us-wards, ſending us Prophet after Prophet, and Precept upon Precept, to preadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us, not willing that any ſhould periſh but that all ſhould come to repentance; yet for all this, and the many days of peace and plenty God did give unto us, inviting us as by gracious opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ammendment, we grew worſe and worſe, and added more abominations in the ſervices of God then was at firſt, until at laſt

                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. <hi>That though God in mercy to his people, gives them often a long time of preadmoniſhments unto repentance, yet if they continue impenitent, he will come quickly againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That time that we look upon as long and far diſtant, as 100, 500, or 1000 years, is but as a day with God, yea, but a little ſpace, and at preſent with him, for he is Eternity it ſelf, without meaſure or number. Though it was in ſome ages after, that Chriſt came in judgment againſt thoſe Aſian churches for their ſins, yet he came quickly againſt them, in a time nearer then they thought of: It is a quick and ſhort time unto ſinners when Judgments reach them unexpectedly: Though it is many hundred years ago that that proud City and Scarlet Whore began her raign, as Queen, and the time of her raign being for 1260 days, yet it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.2. <hi>Babylon is fallen, Babylon is fallen, and is become the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of devils;</hi> that is, God ſees it as already done for the certainty of it, and all things future are as preſent with him. And though it is above 1600 years ſince Chriſt aſcended, yet he ſays <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.20. <hi>Surely I come quickly, Amen.</hi> The people of the old world, and of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> thought the day of God's vengeance afar off, till they were all ſwept away with the deſolating judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. Who would have thought in K. <hi>Charls</hi> his time, when Revelling, Quaffing, Dauncing, and all vanities were in their Throne, that God ſhould come and write a ſentence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and miſery on himſelf and Kingdom, as on <hi>Belſhazzar, Dan.</hi> 5.4.5, 25, MENE, MENE, TEKEL UPHARSIN. <hi>The day is thy Kingdom taken from thee, and given to</hi> Darius <hi>the Median,</hi> ver. 30, 31. Therefore if we be found in the ſame tranſgreſſions with our predeceſſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us not be ſecure, but fear and tremble, left the ſame judgments overtake us alſo: <hi>Happy is the man that feareth always,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe-man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. Let God's judgments come ſooner or later, they will come quick enough upon ſecure unrepentant ſinners; It is too late to prevent the fire when the houſe is in flames. O let that Proverb in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. be no longer uſed in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The days are prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every viſion faileth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>That God's people and Churches fare the worſe for the entertainment of the wicked among them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All of the church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> were not Balaamites or Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans, but that they had them among them that held their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable doctrines, yet however, for free toleration of them, Chriſt will come againſt them all, not only againſt the wicked, to fight againſt them with the ſword of his mouth, but alſo, I will come againſt thee quickly, thou whole church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> for ſuffering theſe abominations in the midſt of thee. The church of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53073:111"/>
                     <hi>Thyatira</hi> had the ſame check for ſuffering the woman <hi>Jezabel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and at laſt, together with the church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> were both wrap'd up in the ſame deſolating judgment and miſery, for the entertainment of theſe abominations among them. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſin is no part of that liberty with which Chriſt hath made us free. Faithful ones may plead for liberty for different things and judgments, in themſelvs not ſimply morally evil, or againſt the poſitive Laws of God; but for for ſpiritual or carnal adulteries, ſuch muſt needs be either the advocates of Antichriſt, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, that plead for their ſufferance and toleration: As there are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſeaſes in bodies, ſo they have their various medicines: If the diſtemperature grows high and inflames, it may endanger the death of the body: So it is in Chriſt's myſtical body, his church, if the diſtempered gangrene grows high and ſpreading, and ulcerate, it may endanger the whole vitals of that church. As there are in natural Phyſick, blood-lettings, evacuatings, healing, corroding and cauterizing medicines; ſo in our ſpiritual Phyſick there are variety of Medicines, ſutable to all the diſtemperatures of the body, the church; and they that uſe Lenitives or healing Medicines, when the diſeaſe calls for corroding or cauterizing Plaiſters, are but mercileſs Phyſitians, and will kill and murther, rather then cure and ſave alive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will object, How is the juſtice of God vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if he ſmites both godly and ungodly together, for the ſins of the wicked among them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer,</hi> If the godly in a church do connive, freely tolerate, or wink at the ſins of the wicked, they are come partakers with them alſo therein, ſo alſo juſtly in their judgments and miſeries. The churches, and faithfull, in <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited by God, for ſuffering the doctrines of <hi>Balaam, Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and <hi>Iezabel</hi> among them, and righteouſly wrapt up in one common calamity, with the Balaamites and Nicolaitans.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, if the faithful in a Church do proteſt, declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and endeavour as much as in them lies, and by all lawful means for the purging out of the evil and erroneous perſons and doctrines among them, they have done their duty towards God, and delivered their ſouls from guilt. Though the common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and judgment of God on the wicked may reach theſe too, without any derogation to divine juſtice; for it toucheth not them as a judgment, but as tryals, and for other good ends of God: <hi>Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel,</hi> and other faithful ſervants of God, ſuffered very much in the Caldean captivity; yet not as for their own ſins, but for other eſpecial ends of God: But very often God doth and will ſave his faithful ones, as wheat amongſt the chaff, by a temporal ſalvation in the midſt of judgments, and deſtruction of wicked ones round about. God will call out righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Lot</hi> from <hi>Sodom,</hi> and will provide <hi>Noah</hi> an Ark, when he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53073:112"/>
comes with flames of fire, or flouds of deſolating waters on the wicked world, did not God's perſevering providence and ſpecial mark of grace appear in this Nation in preſerving and keeping many precious graines of Wheat amongſt all our chaff, in this late day of our winowing and tribulation. And many where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as it were, were taken by the hand by God; as righteous <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and Arks provided for them by God to paſs from <hi>Sodome</hi> and the wicked world, over the flouds, into a land of reſt, the Mountains of <hi>Ararat;</hi> I mean the wilderneſſes of <hi>America.</hi> And ſo indeed the faithful witneſſes of Chriſt, by the Dragon's powring out of flouds of perſecution after them, fled into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and were there preſerved for ſome times, until the day of wrath was over. Therefore when you ſee your faithful <hi>Lots, Noahs,</hi> &amp;c. fly from you, or called by God to places of ſecurity, look then for deſolating times: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20, 21.

                  <p>Obſerv. 5. <hi>When God is wrath with a people, he turns his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mercies into the moſt terrible judgments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word of God's mouth, which is the ſtaff and comfort of his people; he can turn unto the voyce of Trumpets, and as the roaring of many waters for terribleneſs. When we keep cloſe unto Chriſt, then all things are ours, Friends, Servants, Riches, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and our Tables are mercies to us: But when we are become enemies to Chriſt by evil works, then Friends, Servants, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Children, our Tables, and all are become ſnares unto us. When the King frowns on us, all his Courtiers and Nobles will do it alſo: Whilſt God is our Friend all the whole creation will ſerve us freely; but if he frowns all will conſpire and rebel againſt us: His Angels, whom he formerly commanded for our ſafety to pitch their Tents about us, will then be commanded to come with ſlaughter weapons againſt us. When a mans wayes pleaſe the Lord, hee maketh his enemies to be at peace with him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Babylon</hi> could never have hurt <hi>Zion,</hi> till <hi>Zion</hi> had offended: When <hi>Pergamus, Thyatira,</hi> and the reſt of the offending Aſian churches forſaked God, inſtead of the powerful ſword of Chriſt's mouth, or word of grace, in convincing them of ſin, and mortifying their corruptions, or ſpeaking comfortably to them, he ſends forth another word, a word of judgment and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, commanding their adverſaries to go forth with their deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weapons, either of War, Peſtilence, or Famine, to ſweep them off from the land of the living, that their place ſhould be no more found. O therefore let us be ſure to keep God our friend.</p>

To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna;</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, although I will come againſt the wicked ones in the church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and fight againſt them with the ſword of my mouth; yet, <hi>to him that overcometh,</hi> that is, that oppoſeth and eſcapeth the temptations of thoſe pernicious doctrines amongſt them, and keep themſelves undefiled therein, <hi>to them will I give to eat of the hidden Manna.</hi> Here ſome difficulty or interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offers what is meant by this <hi>hidden Manna;</hi> many aſſert it to be Chriſt, which is that inviſible food received by faith, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>John</hi> 6.32, 33, 34. which cometh down from Heaven, and there typified forth by Manna; but, ſaving due reverence to the learned that goes that way, I cannot joyn with them ſingly in that Interpretation: for,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is here called hidden Manna, or ſtrange Manna, not as yet undiſcovered, now Chriſt was the known and manifeſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual food and Manna unto all believers; and ſo that of <hi>John</hi> 6.3. is brought thereby to verifie it, and allude therunto.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Every believer hath Chriſt already as his ſpiritual food and Manna, and therefore it is but a ſurpluſage and tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to promiſe that as a crown and reward to the conquering faithful ones which they enjoy already, even from their firſt day, or in their loweſt ſtate of faith; therefore ſurely it muſt be ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then Chriſt ſpiritually eaten by faith. Manna was the food that came down from Heaven that God gave to his children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.14, 15. &amp;c. And as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and Iewiſh Rabbies teſtifie, in the eating thereof is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented all ſorts of meat to the taſte that the appetite or curioſity could wiſh for; and therefore it was a fit Type for to repreſent Chriſt by, who was the true bread of life that could fill and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all our neceſſities, and that he that ſhould eat thereof ſhould never hunger more: but this is a hidden Manna, a ſtrange ſecret bread of life, not yet made known by enjoyment that is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, it is but a variation of the former promiſes of a crown of life <hi>ver.</hi> 10.11. and to eat of the tree of life in the midſt of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of God, and <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>And I will give unto him the morning

Star, and write the name of my God upon him, and put on him the white rayment,</hi> &amp;c. all theſe are but various expreſſions of the future eternal bleſſedneſs that the conquering Saints ſhall enjoy after the reſurrection: And therefore this hidden Manna that is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them to eat, is the enjoyment of Chriſt in ſuch a hidden manner in that day, that it far paſſes our underſtanding for the excellency and the glory thereof, whoſe eating and participating will be then in a far higher Key, and on a more ſpiritual account, then now we can poſſibly in the ſtate of weakneſs enjoy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; and therefore it is here called the hidden Manna; and as another additional degree of bleſſedneſs to this hidden Manna there is annexed, <hi>And will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone a new Name written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> Some take this Stone to be the Stone of free abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and free juſtification by Chriſt, as having alluſion to that ancient practiſe among thoſe Common-weals that were govern'd by a Democraſie, as <hi>Athens, Sparta,</hi> &amp;c. who when any perſon was accuſed of a crime, they that abſolved and acquitted him, caſt into the pot a white Stone, and they that condemned him caſt in a black Stone; and ſo according to the number of the Stones, the perſon was either acquitted or convicted: and that this was their judicious cuſtome, <hi>Ovid</hi> teſtifies in his 15.

Theſe are as ſeveral prizes ſet forth for him that overcometh in their reſpective games and paſtimes amongſt men. To which the ſpirit here does allude, and promiſeth him that overcometh in his chriſtian combate, <hi>the white Stone, wherein there is a new Name written,</hi> as a prize of his victory and conqueſt; and it is ſuch a ſtone, that there is <hi>a new Name written therein;</hi> that is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is ſuch an excellent glory in this white Stone or prize of victory, that is as yet moſt ſtrange and ſecret, and that never mortal eye yet ſaw, and ſo unſpeakable, that the heart of man cannot conceive the glory thereof; <hi>for the Name of God is written on it, and of the City of God, and of the new</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>that comes down from Heaven,</hi> cap. 3. 12. and no man can perfectly know or deſcribe this glorious new State and Crown of life, or this prize of ineſtimable glory, <hi>this white Stone wherein this new name is written,</hi> but thoſe that ſhall receive it in the laſt day. We know what manner of men we are at preſent, but we know not what manner of men we ſhall be that day, before it be revealed to us: we know now but in part, darkly, as in a glaſs, by medium, figures and reſemblances, as a crown of life, white rayment, hidden manna, white ſtone, new name, and the like; but then we ſhall know it as we are known.</p>

                     </gap>eal graces, not only ſo in appearance and opinion, but in truth and ſincerity; and therefore Chriſt before he fals on the charge againſt her, firſt he gives an approbation and an encouragement to her graces, and in effect tels her: 'Tis true O church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg thy works of grace, as thy true love towards me, which hath produced and brought forth in thee the happy fruits of thy zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſervice, and thy faith enlivened by love, together with thy conſtant patience under ſufferings for my names ſake; and by this it appeareth that thou haſt received the truth in the love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and withal I muſt add unto thy praiſe, that there is a growth and improvment in thoſe gracious works, and the laſt to be more then the firſt: That is Though thy firſt works were done out of much zeal, yet the latter were done on more certain and ſober grounds of knowledg and ſincerer ends then the firſt; and therefore as thou haſt made an improvement of thy graces, ſo thou art more in eſteem and thy works alſo, then at the firſt. By the way here,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. We may Obſerve, <hi>Though the Church of</hi> Thyatira <hi>be never ſo blame-worthy, yet Chriſt will give her her due, and ſet too his Seal of approbation to all that is ſound and righteous in her:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems there were graces ſufficient in <hi>Thyatira</hi> to denominate her a golden candleſtick and a church of Chriſt, notwithſtanding Chriſt had a few things to ſay againſt her; it ſavors not of the Dove-like ſpirit of Chriſt and love, when any ſhall be ſo rigid as will not acknowledg ſuch ſocieties to be churches of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome imperfections in them either in doctrine or manners, though otherwiſe abounding in works of holineſs; as love to God and his Saints, and faith towards Jeſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> zeal towards God's worſhip and ſervice, and in ſuffering for Chriſt's ſake: Doubtleſs with ſome rigid perſons in theſe days the churches of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thyatira</hi> would be unchurched and anathematized by them, had they but authority over them, though Chriſt had ſet his Seal upon them, and marked them as golden candleſticks. As in a natural body ſome members may be rotten and dead, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53073:116"/>
yet a lively body: So in thoſe ſpiritual bodies politiques, there may be ſom members rotten and dead at the root, yet the body ſtill an organical body, and no great hinderance to the whole. And again, in a natural body there may be a catholique diſeaſe ſeaſing upon every part and member of the body, which may render it very uncapable for its ſeruices, and yet ſtill a lively bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So it may be in a church, a body politique; it may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiquely ſick and infected with ſome venomous diſeaſe, ſome peſtifferous doctrine or other; and yet a church ſtill, though a decrepid, infirm, and lame one; but when the diſeaſe comes to be mortal, leaprous, or incurable, it is time then to cry out, <hi>Sum impurus, ſum impurus; Procul hinc, procul ite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the words, <hi>I know thy works, and thy loue</hi> &amp;c.] Here we ſee the good works that God does approve of in his people, and does alſo render them as approved Saints, both unto themſelves and the whole world. Chriſt alone is the publique approved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the room of all his members in the ſight of God, as unto juſtification and perfect righteouſneſs: yet before theſe graces does appear in the Saints to evidence their calling, they are but the children of wrath as well as others. Election does ſecure our eternal eſtate; but before the ſpirit of grace comes to evidence it by faith that worketh by love, ſin and death hath dominion over us: And though we are heirs of all in God's predetermination; yet differ we not at all from ſervants in the ſtate of unregeneracy, yea therein we are ſlaves and captives to ſin and Satan.</p>
                  <p>Theſe gracious works are called <hi>thy works</hi> though they are the gifts of God, and wrought by his ſpirit in us, yet God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does call them ours, becauſe they are acted by the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of our ſouls, as paſſing through our wils, affections and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; and here love or charity is put in the firſt place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the graces of the Spirit: Whether love in order of nature is before faith, I ſhall not here diſpute, only thus much I ſay that all generally grant, that faith's firſt act is an aſſent to the truth, as unto a propoſition; now unleſs love come in to ingrediate the affection unto the truth propoſed, it will only be but a bare opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and never come to a lively faith, Secondly, I ſay, love is here propoſed as firſt in order, as being the moſt excellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. throughout. Now abideth faith, hope and charity, but the greateſt of them is charity; its precedency lies in this,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that it perfumes and enlivens all the other graces; faith it ſelf is dead without it; And to ſuppoſe a faith without love, is to ſuppoſe a man without a ſoul: The gifts of propheſies, tongues, and miracles, are but barren and uſleſs things without this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This hath for its object both God and Man; we exerciſe our faith and hope only towards God and his promiſes, but our charity is extended both towards God and Man: And therefore
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53073:116"/>
love is called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the fulfilling of the Law; it is the whole ſum and hinge on which the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments turn: In this one word charity, both the Tables of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue are abridged.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It excells in that it is the greateſt note of our intereſt in God and Chriſt: Faith is that giveth right unto the promiſes, but love is that giveth life to faith: It is the very ſoul of all our graces; <hi>If we gave our bodies to be burnt for Chriſt and had not charity, it will profit nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3. <hi>By this we know that we are paſſed from death to life, becauſe we love the Brethren,</hi> 1 John 3.14. and Ia. 1.12. <hi>The Crown of life is promiſed to them that love God,</hi> and Rom. 8.28. <hi>Love is made the very diſcovery of effectual calling and election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Love excells in that it is the perfection of the Law; it is the very end of the Commandments, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. and were Love but perfect in us, it would make us perfect Keepers and Obſervers of the Law both towards God and Man. Love knits the Members of Chriſts Body together, and ſo perfects his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: It unites us to God, and ſo maketh the perfecting of divine love in us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.12, 17. and here it is we are commanded twice to put on love above all things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. but once above all things to take the ſhield of faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And laſtly, when faith, hope patience, and all other graces ceaſes, charity abideth. Love is not only a portion for the Saints in this life, but in the other alſo; then we ſhall love God and Chriſt when faith and hope ceaſeth; therefore juſtly did Chriſt in this place, and the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. give it the precedency above al other Graces of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Love brings forth another grace, ſervice, external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and obedience; him whom we love we obey, we ſerve, we honour and worſhip: The ſervice of love is moſt intenſe and effectual. When Chriſt communed with <hi>Simon Peter, John</hi> 21. and asked him thrice, <hi>Simon</hi> Son of <hi>Jonas, loveſt thou me? Yea Lord thou knoweſt it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> Chriſt anſwered <hi>feed my ſheep:</hi> The more love that <hi>Peter</hi> manifeſted, the more ſervice and duty was put upon him. Services that we perform to God, not out of love, but formality or cuſtome, are but as ſcabbed or lame Sacrifices under the Law, which the Lord hated. Right ends in our ſervices are,
<list>
                        <item>Firſt, Love and zeal to God's glory.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, Love to the obedience of God's commandments.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly, Love to the edification of others.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe ends makes us a true and ſincere worſhip, love goeth through all, and is the fulfilling of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thyatira</hi> is approved for her faith, made lively and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by love. True faith is never ſeperated from love, they go hand in hand together; but love hath the precedency for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53073:117"/>
aforeſaid, though faith is firſt in order of nature; for faith is that grace that gives the firſt being unto a chriſtian, but love is the perfection of that being: There muſt be firſt a knowledge of God, and aſſent unto his truths, which is the firſt act of faith, before we can love that God or his Truths; but withal I ſay, there is ſo inſeperable union between theſe two graces, no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath faith a being and a body, but love comes to animate it, to make it ſound, lively and perfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> hence Note, <hi>That it is not a bare opinion or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth, that is a true lively faith, but that that worketh by love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many will one day ſay, we have propheſied in thy Name, taught in thy Name, caſt out devils in thy Name, profeſſed and beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy truths; and yet the Lord will ſay unto them, <hi>I know you not;</hi> and all for want of this grace of love towards God and his Saints. A ſound and true faith contains in it theſe three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ingredients, that gives the very form and being to it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A ſound diſtinct knowledge of the thing believed: <hi>I know and am perſwaded,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.14. Perſons that are ignorant of Gods promiſes, and of the word of eternal life, can never believe aright.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A firm perſwaſion ſtrongly aſſuming the heart. As a ſound believer muſt not be an ignorant ſoul, ſo muſt he not be a wavering-minded man, but muſt have an undeceivable certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth in that he does believe.</p>

                  <p>True faith hath theſe four acts and degrees in it, 1. Knowledge, 2. Aſſent. 3. Adherence. and 4. Aſſurance. A believer may have the three firſt acts, and want the latter; and a ſound beleiver and a juſtified perſon. Though God for cauſes to himſelf known may never give the grace of Aſſurance, yet that faith that only knows God diſtinctly to be a God of ſalvation in his promiſes, to repentant ſinners through Chriſt, and ſo takes him and adheres unto him in the love and truth thereof, doubtleſs that ſoul ſhall never be a caſt-away, though God's preſence of aſſurance and joyful ſatisfaction be never manifeſted unto him. If we be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it is enough, though God reſerves his comfortable preſence and inward love for us unto another world.</p>

carries it in the Greek. A wicked man may ſuffer affliction, but not ſuffer with patience, without murmuring, ſwearing, or blaſpheming as the godly doth. The wicked may haue patience perforce and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, when he cannot help it, the afliction being above his reach to remedy; but the godly is patient as it is an effect of love;

                  <p>The charge againſt <hi>Thyatira</hi> was, <hi>That thou ſuffereſt the woman</hi> Jezabel <hi>who calleth her ſelf a Propheteſs to teach and deceive my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> &amp;c. This woman <hi>Jezebel</hi> here mentioned, doubtleſs was a ſhe Propheteſs of the Nicolaitans, and that ſhe was one of that Sect, is evident from this, that ſhe comes with the ſame curſed Nicolaitiſh doctrines in the 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 15. <hi>verſes</hi> mentioned, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drawing God's people to Idolatry and Fornication.

Next obſerve her falſity and deceit; ſhe is a Propheteſs, and why, it is only to deceive and ſeduce Chriſt's Servants. Thirdly, obſerve the ways and means of her ſeductions, it is by falſe doctrines, by teaching Idolatry, and communicating in the Sacrifices of Idols, and Fornications to be
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53073:119"/>
things indifferent, for I always take theſe to be two great diſtinct ſins and errors of the Nicolaitans, Idolatry and Fornication; and not only Idolatry, which is a ſpiritual Fornication or Adultery, for <hi>Balaam</hi>'s advice was not only that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the buſineſs of Baal Peor, <hi>Mumb.</hi> 25.1, 2. ſhould fall to Idolatry, but to fornication alſo with the Midianitiſh women; ſo alſo <hi>Jezabel, Ahab</hi>'s wife, who provoked him to ſet up Idolatry unto <hi>Baal</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.31, 32. compared to 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.25. was alſo a notable Adultreſs, as by that of 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.22.

                  <p>As there were falſe Prophets Balaamites and Nicolaitans in the church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> ſo there was a falſe Propheteſs and a very impudent one of the ſame Sect in <hi>Thyatira.</hi> If God will have he or ſhe Prophets the Devil will be God's Ape, and will have the ſame: If God to honor that weaker Sex, ſometimes raiſed up ſhe Prophets to help his people, be ſure the Divel will be upon the ſame work, he will have his <hi>Jezabels</hi> his <hi>Maximillae</hi> for her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice alſo.

                  <p>Surely it is not the way of God nor his will, to ſuffer opinions in a church, that are diſſonant from his truth, that will corrupt the ſoul with ſin: Though I ſhould plead for a juſt liberty for tender conſciences in points diſputable, and therein are not to be forced againſt their judgments by any outward power, to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conformity; for that indeed is the way to bring them into the Unity of uniformity, but not into the Unity of the truth; it is a way to make Hypocrites, not Saints: Yet nevertheleſs I ſhould not offer to open my mouth for a licentious liberty of pernitious doctrines or practiſes, that are blaſphemous, idolatrous againſt God or his worſhip or the power of godlineſs; let ſuch bear their cenſures and puniſhments, not only that which is ſpiritual and of Goſpel warrant, but that of the Magiſtrates ſword alſo, he is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabulae:</hi> And to this end he beareth the Sword not in vain.

Chriſt never blames any one of thoſe ſeven churches for the ſins that are ſuffered in another; not the church of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> for the ſins of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> nor <hi>Thyatira</hi> for the ſins of <hi>Sardis</hi> or <hi>Laodicea,</hi> but every one are charged particularly for their own ſins: Neither are the more pure churches of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna,</hi> or <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> empowered, commanded or authoriſed, either joynt in a combination, as a Claſſical Presbitery; or ſingly, as a Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Superintendent over the reſt, to remove or reform the evils among the reſt; but every one is commended apart for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective graces, and every one by it ſelf is commanded to repent and reform apart from their ſinful doctrines and practiſes. In the days of thoſe ſeven churches, and ſome ages after, there was no mention of a Lording Epiſcopacy or Presbitery over many churches of Chriſt at once; but that every particular church of Chriſt had then full power and jurisdiction within themſelves all alike and of one extent within their own boundaries, and that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority in churches came in with the defection and falling away, which was fomented and nouriſhed by the pride of the Biſhops, till at laſt it became purely Antichriſtian. We know all churches are ſiſters, and therefore equal in power and priviledges, under one ſpiritual head, that is Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Par in parem non habet imperium,</hi> Equals can have no power over equals, unleſs by uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation or tyranny, or otherwiſe by compact; if it be only by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and agreement, as when amongſt our ſelves and equals, we chuſe our Parliament men to be our Legiſlators and Rulers; but if ſo churches that are of equal authority get a power into their own hands by agreement among themſelves, over the reſt of their ſiſter churches, call it what you will, either Claſſical, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial or National, ſurely at beſt, it is but of a prudential and civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and to give it a divine ſtamp is more then it will bear, peruſe <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. laſt paſt, where the Spirit ſays to the church of <hi>Epheſus, Thou canst not bear them which are evil, and thou haſt tryed them which ſay they are Apoſtles and are not, and thou hast found them lyars:</hi> M. <hi>Perkins</hi> on that <hi>verſ.</hi> ſays, To the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> God gave a full juridical power either to admit or keep out, examine or caſt out, ſuſpend, or do any other juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical act or acts whatſoever, that was needful in a true church of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Supream and Monarchical; and this reſides only in Chriſt, as he is ſole King and Law-giver of his church, and ſo he is head of the body, and he hath the Keys of <hi>David,</hi> and openeth and no man ſhutteth, ſhutteth and no man openeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. and ſo he hath the power both in heaven and earth, and executes the office of a headſhip and none but him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9, 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly there is a delegated or Miniſterial power which is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by Chriſt to his church; and this is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1, Either the power of judgment and election. Or,</p>

                  <p>But Secondly the power of Office is not in the Multitude, but in ſome one or more, as Paſtors, Elders and the like, which they have called to this Authority and Miniſterial offices, and ſo are in a higher Authority, though inferior to the whole, then any other private members whatſoever: So that whatſoever the whole church does judicially act or cenſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the power of Office is to precede therein and all what is done thereby, it is ſtill <hi>in ordine ad Eccleſiam.</hi> And hence it is evident that the power of judgment and cenſuring, is not a power of Office in the Brethren over their Elders as ſome would object, but a diſtinct power, and the one

                  <p>God gives this woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> moſt corrupt in doctrine and manners, a ſpace, a long ſpace or tract of time to repent: God forbore the old ſinful world a long time under the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> before he brought the Flood upon them, to ſweep them away for their tranſgreſſions: God ſuffered long alſo <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> moſt vile cities in abominations, before he ſent forth fire from heaven to conſume them: How long did God ſuffer the provocations of his own people Iſrael, in idolatries, murmurings, oppreſſions, injuſtices, adulteries, &amp;c. from one age to another, before he would remove the habitation of his glory from Iſrael, yea after they had put the Son of God to death, through their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked malice and enmity towards him; yet how willing was God to call them to repentance, by ſending his Apoſtles and Miniſters among them, to bring them to the faith, if poſſible, and ſo be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and waited long upon this work, for fifty, ſixty years, and upward, until the days of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> when <hi>Titus</hi> overthrew the city of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Jews were ſold for a groat a head, and not one ſtone left upon another in the Temple, as Chriſt had foretold for their obſtinate impenitency and wickedneſs? How long did God forbear us in this Land for the abominations among us; ſins of <hi>Jezabel</hi> of a bloody nature againſt the Saints and Prophets of God, beſides the many ſuperſtitious Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, idolatries, and fornications permitted and countenanced, as it were by authority, for ſome ſeries of years, before the Lord did break out againſt us in wrath and judgment? All this connotes unto us the gracious nature of our God, that he is a God merciful, gracious, long-ſuffering, full of bowels of compaſſion, ready to forgive and remit the very worſt of ſinners, as perſecutors, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, adulterers, Jezabels, Balaamites, Nicholaitans, and what not? upon their repentance, and turning from their ſinful ways unto God and holineſs: Therefore, (O ſinner!) never complain againſt God for want of grace or long-ſuffering towards thee, if thou periſh, the fault is thine own, through thine own perverſeneſs and unbelief, and not God's, for want of grace, mercy, or giving time enough of repentance to thee.</p>

                  <p>Obſerv. 3. <hi>It is moſt juſt with God when he makes the occaſions and inſtruments whereby we have ſinned against God, to be the inſtruments of our puniſhments and chaſtiſements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we turn our Tables into ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, it is juſt with God to make them a ſnare unto us. If we make wine, or our luſts our god, God can make wine and our luſts to be our executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, in ſhortning our days by intemperancy. If we make gold, riches, or honour our <hi>Dalilah,</hi> God may juſtly lay a wedge of gold in our way, as he did to <hi>Achan;</hi> or honour, as unto <hi>Abſolom,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our utter ruine and deſtruction. If <hi>Jezabel</hi> affects her bed and cloſe covertures for her whoredoms and idolatries, God can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make that bed of folly, a bed of great tribulation to her. If we pleaſe our ſelves in the ſociety of evil companions, thoſe very conſorts of ours, God will make them rods of affliction to us: for how ſad will it be unto the wicked in the laſt day, when thoſe that were companions in ſin and wickedneſs, ſhall curſe one another for their wicked examples and encouragements to evil given to one another in their life time: Thus God puniſhes ſin by ſin. If <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will have a hard heart againſt the Iſrael of God, God will give <hi>Pharaoh</hi> a hardned heart in judgment: God hath his hand ſo far in ſin, as in juſtice he can turn it to a puniſhment for ſin; and this is according to the equity of that of the Poet:

                  <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>That children that tread in the ſteps of their wicked parents, are envolved under the ſame judgments with themſelves.</hi>

                  <p>If we be partakers of our Father's ſins, it is juſt that we ſhould be partakers of their puniſhments. If we follow the ſteps of our faithful parents, we ſhall have the ſame reward with them of our faithfulneſs in the latter day. God giveth to every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works; the child ſhall not dye for the ſin of his parent, nor ſhall the child be ſaved for the faith or obedience of his parent: <hi>For the Soul that ſinneth ſhall dye: And he that believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> But as for the little ones that are uncapable of actual ſin or faith, their ſalvation or damnation is according to his will that ſheweth mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardens <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But if it be demanded, How will it ſtand with the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God to cut off little children which are innocent, nor ever yet done good or evil, together in judgment with their parents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Little children that had never committed actual ſin, even babes new born, or in the womb doubtleſs periſhed in the floud, and many in <hi>Sodome,</hi> and yet without impeachment of, or dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to divine Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God can do it out of Soveraignty and abſolute dominion which he hath over his creatures He is the Potter, he that made the Veſſel can break it, he that gave life to babes can take it away, and who can ſay why doſt thou this?</p>
                  <p>Secondly all Infants are defiled with original ſin, and as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin is death, ſo God can juſtly inflict death on them, both temporal and eternal, as the due wages thereof together with their parents.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Little children are part of their parents ſubſtance and family, and God may juſtly puniſh the living parent in his child by death, as well as any others of his ſtock and ſubſtance, as by a temporal puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Though God may often ſweep away in his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral judgments many little innocent children, as by the Sword, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, &amp;c. and yet they not periſh eternally; for violent or ſudden death is no Argument of God's hatred to them; for many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſouls expire by a more terrible and violent death then that of the Sword, Peſtilence, or Famine.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, For the comfort and the better ſupport of the hopes of faithful parents, for the well being of their little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent dying infants, whether they are taken off by God, either by an ordinary death, or in a common judgment, let them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand for their comfort, that God hath made an everlaſting covenant of grace and ſalvation with Chriſt for all his Elect ones, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11, 12. and though the Infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers die before they can receive the promiſe of the Spirit by faith,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53073:124"/>
yet the choſen ones in Chriſt are ſecure by virtue of God's eternal love towards them in Chriſt, being choſen in him from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.14. and let me with reverence ſpeak it, Chriſt may as ſoon periſh as one of them, he being the head, they the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, making up one myſtical church: Had God ever cloathed himſelf with fleſh in the perſon of the Son, had it not been to lay down a ſufficient price and ranſom to divine Juſtice for all his ever beloved choſen ones? And where there is ſuch a predeterminating love as God's is towards his Elect, and ſuch an ineſtimable and compleat price paid for them as Chriſt's death is, how can any ſuch poſſibly periſh without violation and impeachment both of divine Love, and divine Juſtice? This is a ſurer ground of the ſalvation of ſome dying Infants of believing parents, then that that ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſing perſons of theſe days do make, to wit, the parents faith, the condition of the Infant's ſalvation: Dying Infants with thoſe of that perſwaſion, I leave theſe few following conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They ſhould do well in the firſt place to produce that grant which they pretend to be in the Goſpel covenant, that the parents faith is the condition of their Infants ſalvation dying ſo; but this will be done <hi>ad Graecas Calendas:</hi> it ſavors too much of works of Supererrogation and Popery to be true.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If ſome dying Infants of believing parents are ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the condition of their parents faith, then all are ſo ſaved that dyes ſo, before they have forfeited their condition by their own actual tranſgreſſions; and if all of them are ſaved dying ſo, then happier would faithful parents be to ſee all their children dy whilſt Infants and innocent, for then they ſhould be ſure of their ſalvation, then to ſee them live, for ſome of them muſt become reprobate and wicked; for few godly parents have ever had all godly children, <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac, Iſaac</hi> had an <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as a <hi>Jacob, Jacob</hi> had a <hi>Reuben, Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi.</hi> brethren in iniquity, as well as <hi>Benjamins,</hi> ſons of love and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If all Infants of believers, dying Infants are ſaved on the condition of their parents faith, how comes ſome afterwards to forfeit their condition? Are the conditions of the covenant of grace unſtable, and left in the hand of man that is vain and frail, that would ſoon forfeit them all if a thouſand ſalvations were on them? I always thought the death of Chriſt to be the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and meritorious condition of the covenant of grace, and of our ſalvation, and faith to be our principal evidencing condition and qualification, as the way unto life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. and at moſt I take it but as the firſt precedent condition to other graces, for God gives one grace as a reward of the well improvement of the firſt grace, he that encreaſeth his Talent, God multiplies his Talents to him; God gives firſt faith unto his people, before he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53073:125"/>
gives them the other graces of his ſpirit, to wit, of adoption, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or ſanctification. Faith in order of nature is the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous grace unto all others though they are conjunct and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that faith which is ſound and ſincere, <hi>We receive,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>the promiſe of the Spirit through faith.</hi> Faith is made the thorow-fare, conduit and pipe, whereby God convays all his ſpiritual bleſſings and promiſes into our ſouls; it is Man's receptive inſtrument, and the Spirit's revealing inſtrument; the ſpirit takes the things of God, and reveals them to the faithful ſoul by the inſtrumentality of faith, and the ſoul receives and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends them by the ſame inſtrument of faith, and therefore a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inſtrument both of God and Man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Are all believers Infants in the covenant of grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whilſt Infants, and afterwards fall away when come to years of diſcretion? Hath not Chriſt ſaid that the love of God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable? <hi>Io.</hi> 13.1. and is it not impoſſible that any one of his choſen ones ſhould be loſt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. or is his covenant bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.32. or is Chriſt's death and interceſſion unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? <hi>Io.</hi> 17.15, 20, 21. or is God's wiſdom deceived, or his power and goodneſs made fruſtrate or overcome by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of man's ſin? All which are not only abſurd but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If the parents faith is the condition of ſalvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their dying Infants, then Infants are ſaved one way and grown perſons in another way; Infants by the faith of another, to wit, their parents; and grown perſons by their own faith: &amp; how abſurd this is let the judicious conſider. God ſaves none for faith, but ſaves ſome by faith. Faith is not the proper or meritorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the covenant of grace, that alone is the object of faith, Chriſt crucified: Faith is not the condition, but in an improper ſenſe, as repentance and obedience and all other graces are; but I ſhould rather let the word condition lie by us unhallowed for this end, in regard many have ſtumbled at it, by making it an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol rampant; but I ſhould rather call faith the fruits, effects, or ſome ſpecial branch or bleſſing promiſed in the covenant of grace, for it is ſo mencioned in the new covenant, <hi>I will write my Laws in their inward parts, Heb.</hi> 8.10. and what is the great commandment or law of God that will be written in the heart? That ye believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and faith is the gift of God: If any take faith to be the condition of the covenant or of ſalvation only, as a qualification, a medium, or way without which grown intelligent perſons cannot be juſtified or ſaved, with ſuch I ſhould not contend, or ſhould make it a precedaneous condition unto other ſubſequent graces, I ſhould not much quarrel with that neither; for I think it to be the firſt foundation grace that the ſpirit works in the elect Saints of God which produceth, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, and ſanctifieth all other ſubſequent graces in the ſoul
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53073:125"/>
but to make faith, which is our own act, though wrought by God's ſpirit, the condition of our ſalvation in a proper ſenſe, to wit, by performing whereof we may legally and juſtly claim it as our due as wages and debt, the thing promiſed, to wit, life and ſalvation on the performance thereof in a legal way: This is to ſet up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of our ſelves, that we may have that whereof to beaſt of, and glory in our own ſtrength. And in the next place it derogates from all ſufficient merits of Chriſt and his precious death, which is the alone legal condition performed for us, and in our behalfs, and whereby we do legally and in the way of juſtice, claim at the hands of Gods juſtification and remiſſion of ſins, adoption and ſanctification, life, ſalvation, and glorification, and all the good things of the Goſpel: But all theſe things are hid unto us, until the ſpirit comes to reveal them to us by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly and laſtly, If faith therefore will not ſerve turn, but is too ſhort and weak a condition properly and legally underſtood, for the believing parents own ſalvation, then ſurely it will not reach the ſalvation of their Infants; therefore vain to truſt or bind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it for ſuch a work; for it is alone the garment of our elder brother, the white robes of Chriſts righteouſneſs, that is fit to reach and cover not only the faithful parents, but their children alſo if ſo be God hath choſen them in Chriſt by his eternal love of election; but for ſuch Infants as God hath in his eternal preterition paſſed by, as the Potter hath power over his clay to make thereof either veſſels of honor or diſhonor; who ſhall ſay unto God why haſt thou made me thus? I ſay therefore to aſſert the parents faith the condition of their Infants ſalvation, is a groundleſs reaſonleſs aſſertion, not comporting with the leſt ſavor of truth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be excluded out of the Creed of all ſound and orthodox chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What burdens did the late Prelatical party lay on the conſciences of the godly, which they never had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt or his Apoſtles? and therefore they were truly burdens unto them, and very grievous to bear; but Chriſt's bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is eaſie, and his yoke is ſweet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. Every thing of Chriſt is pleaſant unto the enlightned ſoul; though his yoke be heavy unto fleſh and blood, yet it is nothing irkſom, but rather ſweet as hony to the regenerate and ſpiritual chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>That true Chriſtian Doctrine is a burden or yoke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that takes up a burden muſt go through with it, and tugg un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and paſs through all difficulties or elſe he may looſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: It is not a burden or yoke taken up by our ſelves, for of our ſelvs we would not willingly come under it, it is tedious to fleſh and blood; and therefore Chriſt is ſaid to put it on us, he makes us firſt willing by his ſpirit of grace, and then we are ready to yeild our necks unto this gracious yoke, and our backs unto this burden, therefore it will coſt much ſweat to go through with it: Chriſtians under Chriſt's yoke and burden, muſt not think to live at eaſe or at liberty, and ſtray whither their fancies call them; they are under a burden, a yoke, they muſt attend and keep their work, if they be fruitful proficients in the works of Chriſt; though it is a ſweet burden and an eaſie yoke, yet it is ſtill a yoke and a burden that is to be attended to. Some write that Chriſt being reputed <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Carpenter's Son, before he fell to the more publique work of his Miniſtry, he followed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Lawes Trade of making yokes for Oxen, to which that expreſſion of his in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. did allude; but whether that be true or not, I am ſure he made ſpiritual yokes to lay on the necks of his Diſciples; he lays commands on them both naturally moral, and poſitively moral, to which they were obliged unto, and not only they, but all us, and all that ſhall believe unto the end of the world; and therefore we are all commanded to hold faſt this burden, this yoke of Chriſt, his faithful Doctrine and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53073:127"/>
until he come, <hi>hold faſt till I come:</hi> This muſt ſignifie Chriſt's ſecond and general, and not of his firſt, or of his ſpecial coming in ſpirit; for this was ſpoken by Chriſt nere a hundred years after his incarnation, and he was come in ſpirit ſome ſcore years before this was ſpoken; and ſuch as will have it to be meant of Chriſt's coming in ſpirit, this will handſomly follow as a conſequence of ſuch an interpretation, that when Chriſt comes in ſpirit they muſt then let go the truth of Chriſt and his Doctrine; for, <hi>hold faſt till I come,</hi> and no longer; but at his ſecond and laſt appearance, he hath another glorious adminiſtration to diſcover to us which yet we are ignorant of; but after he was come in ſpirit, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hold faſt the former burden and doctrine delivered unto the Saints; and therefore ſure it muſt be intended of his ſecond coming to Judge the world. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That we are to hold faſt the Doctrine of Chriſt, already received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and delivered to the Saints until his ſecond coming to put an end to all.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hold faſt till I come]</hi> Chriſt's burden or doctrine was not laid upon the Saints for that firſt age or generation only wherein it was publique, as ſome vainly dream, but it was to continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all generations, until to him that did hold faſt and overcome, power was given him over the Nations, to rule them with a rod of Iron; now it is evident this power was not yet given by Chriſt unto his Saints; for they are ſtill as Lilies among Thorns, in an afflicted and wilderneſs eſtate, and under the power of the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, until Chriſt ſhall come to give them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe and freedome feom all ſorrows and Anti-chriſtian ſervitude; and therefore Chriſt's doctrine is to continue unto the end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.</p>

ſaid to be given to Chriſt, which in <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. and 27. is ſaid to be given unto the Saints; they are ſo reciprocal and ſo united, that what is done by the one, is ſaid to be done by the other; they are ſo far from being tearmed <hi>contraria,</hi> that they are hardly <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa,</hi> though I ſhall grant the Saints ſubordinate unto Chriſt, yet what is predicated of the one, is often predicated of the other in Scriptures; and therefore it is no hard ſaying to aſſert that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers under Chriſt their head, and as his members, and by his donation and aſſiſtance, ſhall do his own peculiar work as ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate inſtruments unto himſelf, for, <hi>Qui facit per alium facit per ſe;</hi> and ſo may the Saints have power over the Nations, and rule them with a rod of Iron, till they be broken as a Potter's veſſel; and this interpretation ſtands with beſt reaſon; for though our late Bibles have included all the 27. <hi>v.</hi> in a Parentheſis ſaving the laſt clauſe thereof, as if it were on purpoſe to cut it off from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any applicatory reference to the conquering Saints in the 25. and 26. <hi>v.</hi> and to be reſerved ſolely applicable unto Chriſt; but ſurely ſuch Interpreters could not have a righteous intention in ſuch a ſervice; for in the beſt Greek copies as <hi>Stephanus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there is not a tittle or ſtroak of a Parentheſis, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſpeech, in the 25, and 26. <hi>verſes</hi> it is to the overcoming chriſtian, and ſo continued as a farther addition in the 27. <hi>verſe,</hi> until the latter clauſe thereof come in, <hi>even as I have received of my Father,</hi> which makes it plain: For what had Chriſt received of his Father? <hi>Power over the Nations, to rule over them with a rod of Iron, and to breake them in pieces as a Potter's veſſel, Pſal.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.15. as if he had ſaid, even as I have received this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and dominion of my Father over the Nations, ſo will I give it to him that ſhall overcome and get the victory over all falſe ways and practiſes, and he ſhall be co-partner with me in this my Throne and Kingdom, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. 21. The intention of the Spirit being cleared in theſe words to be the conquering Saints to whom power is given over the Nations to rule them with a rod of Iron and to break them in pieces as a Potter's veſſel. Next I ſhall enquire what the power is that is given them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is ſuch a power whereby they ſhall judge the Nations, ſo our new Annotations have it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is ſuch a power that they thereby ſhall get victory, and ſubdue all theirs and the truth's Enemies; ſo Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> on the place.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is ſuch a power whereby they ſhall break all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Enemies of Chriſt to peices as a Potter's veſſel. The firſt is confirmed from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Jude,</hi> 14.15: The ſecond and third are confirmed from this <hi>verſ.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. compared to <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.18, 19. &amp;c. where Chriſt and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies powers out the full Vials of divine wrath upon all their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate enemies to the utmoſt. Again, This power over the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53073:129"/>
Nations, and ruling by a rod of Iron, and breaking them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as a Potter's veſſel, muſt needs be underſtood of a corporal breaking, ruling and overpowering, and not a ſpiritual: So that ſpiritual is a ſtrange worke to a rod or Scepter of Iron; Chriſts golden Scepter of his word is the only inſtrument to make the Nations bow to his ſpiritual Kingdom; but for the refuſers thereof, he hath another Scepter, in another day to be exerciſed on them, a rod of Iron and force, whereby he will deſtroy the mighty ones of the earth, that are his enemies, and will daſh them in pieces like a Potters veſſel, to the making the Kings and Judges of the earth wiſe, and to kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That Chriſt's faithful Saints have a day to come, to judg, rule, and reigne over the Nations, as well as now to ſuffer under them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this be the day of their ſufferance and patience, yet there is a kingdom joyned to it, <hi>cap.</hi> 1. 9. Though <hi>John</hi> was a brother and companion to the ſeven churches in tribulation and patience, yet he was too in the hopes of the kingdom to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This Kingdom was never yet fulfilled to the Saints of God, but ſtill rather the contrary hitherto: the Nations of the world break the Saints and churches of Chriſt by their iron Scepters of force and power: Both Mahometanes and Popiſh Antichriſtian Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Princes, not ſparing Chriſt's little flock, but breaking them in pieces as a Potters Veſſels, and therefore it is moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that they ſhall have a day too, as a reward of their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſufferance, wherein they ſhall lead captivity captive, and give their enemies the ſame meaſure that they formerly meted forth unto the Saints, for they are worthy. 2. This kingdom as yet hitherto was not given to the Saints, nor yet will be; for this power over the Nations, and this rod of iron is put into their hands, as the reſult of their perſeverance in the truth at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, as in the laſt precedent verſe is declared: <hi>Hold fast till I come;</hi> and in that day when Chriſt comes to him that overcometh, he will give power over the Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this was promiſed long after Chriſt's firſt coming in the fleſh, and alſo after his ſpecial coming in the ſpirit; and therefore yet there will be a day when he will come again to fulfil this promiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ultimate end of all; and for any to expect this rule over the Nations by the rod of iron, before Chriſt comes and appears in the clouds to the performance of this great work: they may reigne, but without Chriſt; they may get power over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but not in Chriſt's way, or his giving. Hence another Note ariſes.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53073:129"/>
uſe any other weapons therein then are ſpiritual, we may loſe the benefit of his ſecond kingdom, which is reſerved as a reward of our obedience under the firſt kingdom: He that walks ſpiritually and ſoberly under the firſt of grace and ſpirit, doubtleſs the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond alſo will be his portion; otherwiſe he is in danger to loſe both his comforts here, and his portion hereafter in the other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo.</p>

A true Miniſtry and the Spirit are never ſeparated: Though I ſhould not ty up God to thoſe means only, yet ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it is in vain to expect Chriſt in the Adminiſtration of the Spirit, without the Miniſterial Adminſtration of his Stars and Angels: They are as it were the Charioteers of the Spirit. The Word is the Spirit's <hi>Vehiculum</hi> or Chariot, but the Miniſters thereof are thoſe that carry and ſupport this Chariot on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; never think that the Spirit, the glory of this Chariot, will come or reſt in our Temples, unleſs it be brought unto us by the feet of thoſe Stars, thoſe beautiful ones that bring the glad tidings of peace, God hath ſo linked together in his all-wiſe decrees and predeterminations the concatenation of ſubordinate cauſes or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums unto ſalvation, that ordinarily one cannot be effected
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53073:131"/>
without the other; and ſo we are ſaved by faith in Chriſt through the ſanctification of the ſpirit and word: One will not doe this work without the concurrence of the other; but when Chriſt comes with them joyntly together, either to a particular Soul, or Church, he makes them, of a wilderneſs and a land of darkneſs, a <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and a land of light: And happy is that people to whom Chriſt ſo cometh with his ſeven Spirits and his ſeven Stars, with his gracious Spirit, and ſpiritual Miniſtry; and for ſuch whoſe lot is fallen in ſuch a Land, I ſay, their lot is fallen in a goodly Heritage.</p>
                  <p>But what is the reaſon that Chriſt here appears under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of one that hath the ſeven Spirits of God and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Stars?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> Chriſt is upon diſcovery of the hypocritical defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and thererefore he needs to appear not only under a ſearching, piercing and ſpiritual adminiſtration, as one that can ſearch the reines and hearts, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 23. and as one that hath the ſeven ſpirits of God, or the ſevenfold ſearching Spirit of God which knoweth the hidden things of man; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo under a lightſom adminiſtration of the ſeven Stars, for a further diſcovery and conviction of their hypocritical practiſes; and therefore the church of <hi>Sardis</hi>'s hidden hypocriſies and inward rottenneſs, being ſearched out by the Spirit of God, and made manifeſt by the true light and Miniſtry of the ſeven Stars, Angels or Miniſters of the word, he falls upon them with his charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and tells them, <hi>I know thy works that thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt and art dead.</hi> Hence by the way Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That Chriſt's ſpiritual Miniſtry in the hands of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Embaſsadors, can try the ſecret and hidden things of man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſpiritual man ſaith the Apoſtle, judgeth all things, and is judged of none: And if a private ſpiritual member may judge, <hi>Judicio diſcretionis,</hi> then ſurely much more the publique Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and authoriſed Miniſters of Chriſt; they can try by the Word and Spirit whither our works &amp; profeſſion be only in name and outward, or whither inward and ſincere; they are the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Aſſemblies, and the experienced Elders of the church, and therefore are and ought to precede and excel all others in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpiritual work and ſervice whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. Another Note hence is, <hi>That the Spirits's Method is firſt to convince of ſin, before it manifeſts its remedy againſt ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The whole,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>need not the Phyſitian,</hi> but the ſenſible ſick and wounded: Chriſt firſt convinces <hi>Sardis</hi> that ſhe had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Name, that ſhe lived but was dead, before he lays down her remedy in the third <hi>ver.</hi> in bringing her to repentance; ſo he deales with <hi>Pergamus, Thyatira,</hi> and other delinquent churches alſo. It is an Anti-ſcriptural Method of ſome that preach up faith and repentance unto a ſinful and backſlidden people before
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53073:131"/>
they have firſt fully convinced them by the Spirit in the Word, that they are under bondage, ſin and miſery: This is no legal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as the Antinomiſts do conjecture, but of a ſpiritual and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſpirit; for unleſs we be firſt ſenſibly convinced of our loſs and miſery by ſin, how ſhould we looke for a Saviour or ſalvation by faith in Chriſt? All the primitive converts that we read of, were firſt pricked unto their hearts for ſin, before they asked, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 2.</p>
                  <p>But to return to Chriſt's charge againſt <hi>Sardis; I know thy works, for thou haſt a Name that thou liveſt, but thou art dead,</hi> as if he had ſaid, Thou haſt a name, a reputation that thou liveſt, that is, that thou art a faithful profeſſing church and liveſt in me by faith, but thou art dead, that is, not altogether dead, for then it was in vain to put her afterwards to ſtrengthen the remainder of grace, but as good as dead, low, weak, and infirm, and that faith and profeſſion which thou pretendeſt to be in thee, is but as a dead profeſſion, and liveleſs faith. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That though Churches may carry a fair outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a common reputation of faithful ones, yet they may be very hipocritical, and no better then dead, liveleſs, and rotten at the root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This church at <hi>Sardis</hi> had a name, that ſhe lived, but ſhe was dead; her graces were even at deaths dore, yet ſtill would keep up the Name of a chriſtian church: Who higher in profeſſion and name then the church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Doth ſhe not take unto her ſelf and go under the name of Catholique, as if ſhe had been the only church that holds the general faith delivered unto the Saints? And yet what church more dead and rotten then ſhe? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our nominal faith and common-reputed chriſtianity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, yet we may be dead to all motions and operations of all true ſpiritual life in the church of <hi>Smyrna, cap.</hi> 2. 9. they were thoſe which ſaid they were Jews, but they were not, and Chriſt tels them, <hi>I know the blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Jews &amp; are not, but are of the Sinagogue of Satan:</hi> It is a kind of blaſphemy and diſhonour done unto God, when under the cover of profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we endeavour to excuſe our errors and profaneſs: Open oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is leſs diſhonorable unto God, then impure and dead lives under the vizor of profeſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.28, 29. That froward Son in the Parable was leſs guilty that ſaid, he would not do the will of his Father, then he that ſaid I will, and did it not; <hi>James</hi> reſolves the Queſtion in that Interrogation of his, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 14 <hi>What doth it profit if a man ſaith he hath faith and hath not works? can faith ſave him?</hi> meaning a dead nominal faith without fruits and works: So would I put the queſtion here, what will the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded faith and chriſtianity of our nominal and national chriſtians profit or advantage them? The Divel hath ſuch a faith that is only in the tongue and the lip, and yet fare nough from ſalvation

or the grace of God; theſe formal outward graces are ſo far from bringing in any real comfort or hope of glory in the future to the ſouls that only have them, that they bring in real diſadvantage and loſs unto them; for they argue a conviction of the truth, yet a refuſal thereof in the love and power thereof. And ſecondly it hath been always a harder work of the Miniſtry, to bring preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and formal profeſſors unto the power of godlineſs, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Harlots, Publicans and Sinners; witneſs the Phariſees of old in Chriſt's days, and the National, Formal Jews, who would boaſt of their carnal priviledges, and of having <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, and the Oracles and Temple of God among them, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the late Levitical Prelatical Tribe among us, and yet who more blind and dead then they unto true ſpiritual knowledg? And who more eager perſecutors and enemies to Chriſt, his ways and Saints, then thoſe Formal National Jews, who ſay they are Jews and are not, but are of the Sinagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan?</p>
                  <p>But to give you a teſt and taſte to try whither your profeſſion and faith be a living profeſſion and faith or not.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, True and lively faith uniteth us to Chriſt, and draweth life and vertue from him, <hi>I live by faith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. You know there is life in a body by the notions and beating of the pulſes: A living faith will be active, and diſcover it ſelf in ſome gracious effects and operations: If Chriſt be in you, he will live in you, he will not be dead and idle, but be moving in you to gracious duties and operations; for there is none liveth in Chriſt but he bringeth forth much fruits, <hi>Io.</hi> 15.5. It is true, faith may not always be alike lively and active; but where it is true and real, it will be always living; and though you be not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its activity, yet you will be ſenſible of deadneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain under it, which is a ſigne of a living faith, though not a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Where this true faith is, there will be its conſtant concomitant that forcible principle love. See <hi>cap.</hi> 2. 19. Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction followeth perſwaſion; and where love is, there will be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and worke, for faith worketh by love; for when we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend by faith God's love in Chriſt to us, it begets in us a return of love, and acts of ſervices and thankfulneſs to God. True faith will not be idle, but will be a working faith, and will produce that labour of love mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A living faith muſt needs be active, being wrought by the quickning ſpirit of Chriſt; help engageth to action, and where the ſpirit of Chriſt ſhall worke, who ſhall reſiſt his power?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Where true faith is there will be high aimes to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God: for it will not be ſo diſ-ingenious to take and receive
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53073:132"/>
mercies from God, but it will ſtudy how to give and render unto God due praiſes and glory for it; for we are not redeemed by Chriſt to live unto our ſelves, but to glorifie God in our ſouls, bodies and ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Well then, try your faith and profeſſion whether it be dead or formal, or active or living, by theſe few particulars; it is not a naked aſſent or unactive outward profeſſion will ſerve turn, this is dead and liveleſs, yea twice dead, and to be plucked up by the roots, <hi>Jud.</hi> 12. dead in your firſt natural condition, and dead in your hypocritical profeſſion; for by this it appeareth never to be otherwiſe with you: But a lively faith is a working faith, by and through the influence of Chriſt and his ſpirit, being zealous of good works, and all for Chriſt's ſake and his glory. <hi>Paul</hi>'s whole life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. was as it were conſecrated to Chriſt; for to me to live is Chriſt ſays he, that is, my life is Chriſt's, for his uſes, his purpoſes, and his glory: In ſhort, a true and lively faith works by Chriſt by the continual ſupply and influence of his ſpirit, and for Chriſt, and with aim at his glory.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>'Tis very uſual for dead Formaliſts to carry a higher hand in outward profesſion then the real Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sardis</hi> pretends highly to faith, and to a name that ſhe lived, beyond her ſiſter churches; and the name was only that ſhe aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, for in the truth of grace ſhe was no better then dead and rotten. It is not very uſual ſtill among dead and carnal chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to boaſt of their chriſtianity, their baptiſme, their church, their external ordinances and the like? They needs would ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the name of chriſtians, as the carnal Jews, that ſaid they were Jews and were not <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. So unto theſe carnal Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, the name of chriſtians is pleaſant to them, yet ſtill are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the true Saints of God and the power of godlineſs; and the reaſon of this is, in that they perceive they want the true work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith which is only acceptable unto God, all being naturally ſelf-lovers, they would needs content themſelves and God too, if they might with a guilded ſophiſticate and dead faith and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to be had at an eaſier rate then the true one, which ſhould commend them unto God, and denominate them his Saints in the eye of the world; but this faith is too ſhort for ſuch a work, being dead, falſe, and liveleſs, as a carcaſs without a ſoul, but that is the faith that juſtifieth and Chriſt accepteth that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3.</p>

                     <hi>Sardis</hi> is brought by it even to death's door; her graces that were once eminent, are come thereby to ſome ſmal remainders, and they too almoſt extinct and neer the grave; and though death it ſelf (I mean ſpiritual) hath not yet ſeized her, yet ſhe is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what neer it; ſhe is under the ſhadow of death, for ſhe ſleeps and is called to awake, and to ſtir up the remainders of life that is in her, leaſt ſhe takes her laſt ſleep by the ſpiritual death of grace here, and eternal death hereafter.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53073:133"/>
power of <hi>Sardis</hi> to awake her ſelf, recover her ſelf and renew her graces without going to Chriſt by faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Negatively Chriſt is ſet up for that very end, not only for a propitiation, If any man ſin we have an Advocate; but it is alſo from his influence and from him, as the Fountain of life whereby all our graces are maintained and kept alive, <hi>For the life I live</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſays) <hi>is by the life of the Son of God:</hi> If Chriſt ſhould withdraw his gracious preſence from our ſouls, we ſhould never awake out of ſin, nor do our firſt works, or reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our ſelves by repentance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This duty to awake and renew their graces was ſet on thoſe of <hi>Sardis</hi> that had already received the firſt grace and Chriſt by faith; for it is here ſaid, <hi>ſtrengthen the things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;</hi> therefore they had a being though a ſorry one; and thoſe that have received grace from Chriſt are in a capacity to work from the power of that grace: <hi>Having received the promiſes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, Chriſt the great end and object of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes) <hi>cleanſe your ſelves,</hi> go on in the work of ſanctification in the power of Chriſt; for all our gracious acts are to be done in and through his continued power and influence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When we are commanded to awake, ſtrengthen and renew our ſelves by repentance &amp;c. they muſt be always taken to be as inſeparable parts of a lively faith; for we cannot awake from ſin unleſs we firſt look upon Chriſt in the promiſes; neither can we poſſibly renew or reſtore our falne graces before we firſt eye God in Chriſt, <hi>out of whoſe fulneſs we receive grace for grace:</hi> Therefore in vain to ſet home ſpiritual duties on perſons that have not firſt received light and life from Chriſt. Chriſt is the firſt work that muſt be offered and received to and by ſouls before they can act towards God in the leaſt acceptable ſervices.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Grace may be very low and yet not dead, it was as ſparks of fire under much aſhes, with <hi>Sardis;</hi> and yet we know ſparks are as real fire, though not as fervent and virtual as a flaming one. Indeed it was low with <hi>Sardis</hi> in her ſpiritual condition; and it is moſt juſt with God when we are great ſinners againſt him, that he hides much of his gracious preſence from us: When by ſin we quench the operations of the ſpirit of God, God may juſtly quench its effects towards us; but no ſooner ſhall we follow the motions of the ſpirit, and renew by repentance, but preſently God gives a more enlivening and effectual ſpirit into our ſouls; and notwithſtanding his former withdrawings, yet it is but a Fatherly chaſtiſement, not an utter dereliction and forſaking.</p>

Obſtinacy in ſin and unbelief was their cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, and faith is the Gentiles inciſion and graffing in; as the one is cut off by unbelief, ſo the other is graffed in by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. Thoſe few names in <hi>Sardis</hi> that do hold faſt the faith, they are in a ſafe condition, whilſt all the reſt of that church may periſh utterly; the firſt are marked and written in the eternal book of life, of God, and of the Lambe, and therefore cannot periſh; but after God had finiſhed his work at <hi>Sardis, Thyatira, Rome, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. and called his Elect out of them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their eternal happineſs, he can remove the current of his Election to another people without any changeableneſs or ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change in him, and make thoſe very people in their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities the very ſeat and Sinagogue of Satan, who were once his beulahs, darling, and beloved ones.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there are guilded formal hipocritical graces and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and ſuch may not be only ready to dy, but dead, twice dead, dead at the root, and fit for nothing but to be plucked up and caſt into the fire; and therefore it is very ordinary in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſay that ſuch are fallen away, periſhed, and loſt from their faith which they ſeemed to have, all their graces are in the outward appearance only. So <hi>Demas, Simon Magus, Judas, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> &amp;c. may be ſaid to fall away from the faith, becauſe they had never the truth of real grace in them; all was but ſeeming formal, hypocritical, and at beſt but hiſtorical, which the divels may have, and for all this periſh everlaſtingly.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>It is a great mercy for God to leave ſome remains of grace in a ſinful Church and people.</hi>

ſouls; for when the ſoul of the ſoul is gone, the ſoul will be ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and dead unto every good and ſpiritual worke: As long as there is life in us, though it is infirm and weak, yet there is ſome hopes of recovery; but being once dead there is no hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption from the grave: So as long as we have the Spirit of Chriſt, though it works but faintly and weakly by reaſon of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in us; and if it comes but to the firſt ſtep and loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſpiritual life, to wit, to be ſenſible of its dead and carnal condition, and to complain under it, there are good hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery unto ſuch a ſoul; and unto ſuch I may boldly ſay unto its comfort: Awake, <hi>and ſtrengthen the things which remain that are ready to dy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 3. <hi>Though our graces are but weak, and low, and ready to dy, yet it is our duty to cheriſh, ſtrengthen, and confirm them until we bring forth the worke of Chriſt within our ſelves unto perfection.</hi>

but ſome ſhall ſit upon twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael: all ſhall be ſhining Stars, but ſome of a greater Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude then others. But to proceed,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I have not found thy works perfect before God.</hi> It was not a legal perfection that Chriſt could not find in <hi>Sardis,</hi> he did never ſeek for that abſolute perfection in them, that would be in vain, ſeeing they were ſo full of Imperfections: But yet this intimates, that the faithful chriſtians and their works may be perfect before God; although they are not found perfect in <hi>Sardis,</hi> yet may be found perfect in others that are more ſound and godly: For the clearing of which underſtand, that ſometimes in Scripture perfection is taken for ſincerity and uprightneſs, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walk before me &amp; be thou perfect,</hi> that is, upright &amp; ſincere, as <hi>Iob</hi> 1.1. he was <hi>a man that was perfect and upright, one that feared God and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed evil;</hi> he was a plain ſimple man, honeſt at the heart, in this ſenſe the works of <hi>Sardis</hi> were not perfect before God, they were not honeſt ſincere and upright according to his will, they were Hypocritical in name, ſhew, and appearance, only not in truth and ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Perfection may be taken, 1. As reſpecting our juſtification. Or, 2. Our ſanctification. The firſt of theſe in a ſtrict ſenſe, is a compleat perfection; for the Saints are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Chriſt their head, as unto juſtification, and from all ſin and the guilt thereof; there is not one ſin left which is not waſhed away by his blood; in this reſpect they are perfect; <hi>By one offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> Heb. 10.14.</p>
                  <p>Then, Secondly, There is a perfection of ſanctification and holineſs. And that is,
<list>
                        <item>1. In the reſpect of the beginnings and parts thereof.</item>
                        <item>2. In reſpect of the prevailing degree thereof.</item>
                        <item>3. In reſpect of the aimes thereof.</item>
                        <item>4. In reſpect of the duration and perſeverance of it.</item>
                        <item>5. In reſpect of others.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Saints in this life have a perfect beginning of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as to its parts, becauſe it begins in every part; they are ſanctified throughout in ſoul, body and ſpirit 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. though every part be not throughout ſanctified, by reaſon of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of mediums by which they are ſanctified, yet they are ſanctified in every part throughout, in underſtandings, wills, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, deſires, memories, thoughts, and hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They have every grace in their ſouls, not only in the truth thereof, but in the prevailing degree thereof; as when faith, love, patience, humility, &amp;c. overcome infidelity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, impatience, pride, and other their oppoſite vices and evils: So when this work of ſanctification is begun in all parts thereof, it may be ſaid a perfect work in beginning; and when it comes
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53073:135"/>
to the prevailing degree thereof, it may be called a perfect work, having prevailed againſt its contrary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are likewiſe perfect in reſpect of their aims and deſires; God accepts the will for the deed; and he that aims and ſtrives for perfection, God accepts as perfect, though mixed with much imperfections: Chriſt could not find the works of <hi>Sardis</hi> perfect in this ſenſe neither.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are likewiſe perfect in reſpect of their durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Apoſtacy from the faith and truth will looſe the honor of perfection, and makes their crown to wither; when a righteous (or perfect) man turneth to iniquity, all the righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In reſpect of others the Saints are perfect ſouls: compare them unto the guilded out ſide formal chriſtians, and they are gold and perfect in reſpect of them; and ſo Chriſt could not find the works of <hi>Sardis</hi> perfect before him, as thoſe of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. Hence Note firſt,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>The great cauſe that our works are not perfect, but defective before God, is for want of honeſt ſincerity in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sardis</hi> was blamed for this very thing, and for want of this grace; ſhe carried a fair name that ſhe lived in her pretended graces, but ſhe was dead, there was no ſincerity and truth in them. If we ſuppoſe a man to worſhip God in all his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and avoid all outward evil; yet if there be double-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his ſpirit, all is caſt off by God as abominable. Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is that that gives perfection to every grace, it is the very truth and ſpirit of every grace; as when we believe, we muſt believe ſincerely; when we love, we muſt love ſincerely and cordially; when we ſorrow or repent, it muſt be done ſincerely, that is, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fully, without any mixture or hypocriſie; for a double minded man God doth hate: Sincere <hi>quaſi ſine cera,</hi> without wax, without compoſition; and as the word here beares it in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I have not found thy works full, there was ſomwhat wanting within to make them compleat and perfect; without this ingredient grace of ſincerity, all our duties are but as ſounding Braſs, and a tinckling Cimbal: But add ſincerity unto the leaſt and moſt imperfect of our duties, and they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the eſteem of God moſt perfect. God accepts a Lamb from <hi>Abel</hi> offered in ſincerity, rather then clouds of Incenſe and thouſands of Sacrifices from a wicked and profain <hi>Cain:</hi> Yea if it be but a widdows mite, or ſome Goats hair coming from one that is ſincere, God looks upon it as a rich preſent, and calls the preſenter thereof perfect. Truth of grace and ſincerity is our perfection here; but in the world to come, we ſhall have perfection in the higheſt degree, as well as the perfection of ſincerity and truth of grace in this life; therefore let us ſo walk before God as becometh perfect ones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:53073:136"/>Obſerv. 2. <hi>It is the Saints duty that they aim and preſs after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in all their graces, works, and duties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The church of <hi>Sardis</hi> was worthily blamed for want of this perfection, her works were not full and entire, there was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wanting, and therefore blame-worthy and imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are to preſs after the perfection of juſtification by faith, and evidenced by love and works, and ſo make their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and juſtification ſure unto their own ſouls, and manifeſt it unto others alſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To ſeek after perfection in all graces and parts of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, in ſouls, bodies, and ſpirits, to be perfect, intire, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, <hi>Ja.</hi> 1.4. as ye abound in every thing in faith, and utterance, and knowledg, and all diligence; ſee that ye abound in this grace alſo, to wit, charity. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. There muſt not one neceſſary grace be wanting in true Saints; though ſome one may be more eminent then others, yet the truth of all muſt be there, as they will have faith, they will have patience, as patience, love, zeal, humility, ſelf-denial, and all other graces whatſoever; <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy in all manner of converſation</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15.16. and this muſt be alſo in the prevailing degree thereof; for, <hi>his ſervants ye are whom ye obey;</hi> if ſin be ſtronger in thee then grace, then ye are ſinners and wicked ones; but if grace prevail, then are ye gracious and perfect ones.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Their aims and deſires muſt be after perfection, they will not be contented with a little grace, no leſs meaſure will ſerve their turn then what they enjoy after the reſurrection, <hi>I would by any means attain to the reſurrection of the dead</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) Phil. 3.11. their aims are no lower then unto the glorious and everlaſting ſtate, and therefore do alwaies preſs on unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their deſires are ſomewhat infinite, as the glory they expect: Leaving theſe things that are behind <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. and herein their aims and deſires will appear more perfect, in that they hate ſin ſo perfectly that they cannot be quiet until it be aboliſhed, and they freed from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the guilt thereof, by juſtification in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the piercing power thereof, by the ſanctification of the ſpirit of grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the very being of it, in their glorification.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are to aim at perfection in duration and perſeverance: As they are not to want any grace in the truth thereof, or in the prevailing degree thereof, ſo are they not to want it in any part of their lives, for the Crown is given to him that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. True Saints preſs forward to excel and precede other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and outſide chriſtians in all duties of grace and perfection; he that hath any grace will always deſire more; a holy ambition
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53073:136"/>
in grace and goodneſs is very commendable. God tells Satan that there was none like <hi>Job</hi> on the face of the earth, <hi>Job</hi> 1.8. a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and upright man. Many deſire to be before others in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, riches, and power, but few deſire to excel in grace: If we be true Saints and aim at perfection, we will not think it enough to be like others in grace, but labour to go beyond others in all good and perfect works: Hence the Quakers may ſee and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that we hold a perfection in this life, though not an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute legal one, whereunto nothing can be added, as they; but an Evangelical one, upon better grounds and principles.</p>

                        </bibl> Remember therefore how thou haſt received, and heard, and hold faſt, and repent; if therefore thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>Call to minde therefore the doctrine of grace which thou haſt formerly received and heard, and cleave faſt thereunto, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thy ſtraying there from: But if thou wilt not repent, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd out of this thy ſleep of ſin, I ſhal come as a thief, ſuddenly unawares upon thee, and ſeize on thee with unexpected judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Chriſt takes up this metaphor and compariſon of coming as a thief, for divers reaſons. 1. Becauſe a thief cometh ſpeedily, in a time when no man looks for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.43. This ſets us on a diligent watchfulneſs. <hi>If the good man of the houſe did know in what watch the thief would come, he would watch, and not ſuffer his houſe to be broken thorow, or his goods ſtolen.</hi> 2. As a thief comes in the dark or dead of night, ſo Chriſt comes when there is the greateſt darkneſs, and deepeſt night of errour on the whole world; and therefore Chriſt ſays in <hi>Luke, when he comes, ſhall he find faith on earth?</hi> True faith will be ſuch a rarity at Chriſts coming, that it will be found in very few, his elect only. This quickens our faith, and puts us upon the tryal of it. 3. A thief comes prepared and reſolved to over-maſter all oppoſitions: ſo Chriſt's coming in judgement is with power, and to tread down, and make all his enemies his footſtool. This ſupports and comforts the diſtreſſed afflicted Saints: He formerly came as a Lamb to ſuffer, and he after came as a comforter, to ſupport all thoſe for whom he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and died: and he hath an other coming, his ordinary particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar temporal judgements againſt his enemies, which he frequently and very often ſends forth againſt them for their tranſgreſſions, and ſo he threatens to come here againſt <hi>Sardis</hi> and his offending churches. And laſtly, he comes in his laſt and ultimate judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with great power and glory, to overthrow and deſtroy all his antichriſtian foes and enemies whatſoever, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. it is ſaid, <hi>Lo, I come as a thief:</hi> and preſently follows the great battel of <hi>Armageddon,</hi> and the utter deſtruction of Babylon, by the ſeventh Vial of God's plagues and judgements.</p>

                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:53073:137"/>Firſt, from the former part of this verſe, obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That a calling to mind of God's former gratious dealings with us, is not only a great preſervative against ſin but an effectual means for the recovery out of ſin, by a holy repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look back unto the Rock from whence thou art hewen, and review thy former unregenerate ſtate, and how you were therein aliens, ſtrangers, and enemies unto God by evil works, and how it is far better with you now in your ſtate of faith, then it was then in ſin and wrath: for when ye have ſin preſented unto you in its enticements and provocations, it will make gracious ſouls to reaſon thus with themſelves, Was I not once an enemy unto God in my ſinful unregenerate ſtate, and ſhall I again fall back into it, as the Sowe into the myre? God forbid! <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin against God?</hi> Will not then my latter eſtate be far worſe then the firſt? Becauſe God hath been gracious unto my poor ſoul, and delivered it as a Bird out of the ſnare, or ſnatch'd it as a brand out of the fire, ſhall I again caſt my ſelf into the bonds of Satan, and into the flames of hell, by my turning this grace of God into ſin and wantonneſs? The Lord forbid! Again, for the recovery of backſlidden ſouls, that are almoſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually dead, and have almoſt nothing but the name and common reputation of living ones; It is moſt uſeful and advantagious to ſuch poor ſouls, for their recovery, to recognize and look back on thoſe good things they formerly received of God, and heard concerning him. For firſt, They heard that God was a gracious reconciled God, and a merciful Father in Jeſus Chriſt, ready to receive thoſe of his choſen ones, even in their blood and ſin, that did come to him by faith in Chriſt to be healed of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; and this they not only heard by the hearing of the ear, but received it alſo into their hearts by faith: And if God was ſo ready then to receive us into reconciliation with himſelf, whiles enemies unto him, how much more will he be now ready and willing, being reconciled by his blood, to receive us again into his gracious favour after our backſlidings, upon our repentance, and turning unto him from our ſins then formerly, being now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted children, and no longer ſtrangers and enemies. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of this grace, made the prodigal childe in the Goſpel, to return unto his father, and he was not miſtaken of his father's good will towards him; for, <hi>as ſoon as his father ſaw him</hi> but <hi>a far off, he had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kiſsed him, Luke</hi> 15.20. Oh the wonderful grace of God! That no ſooner have we hearts or deſires to return unto God, and to have an eye towards him, after we have played the prodigals, and gone aſtray from him by evil works, but preſently he meets us more then half way, being yet a far off, and falls upon our necks, and kiſſes us with kiſſes of his love and favour. Though we play the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, yet we are children ſtill; the prodigal was a ſon, though he
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53073:137"/>
plaid the bankcrupt, and ſpent almoſt all his ſtock of grace. The conſideration that we are children, though wanton ones, will make us deſire to return unto our father, though provoked againſt us by our ſinful courſes; and for our comfort and encouragement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, conſider that of <hi>John, If any man ſin, we have an advocate with the father, Jeſus Christ the righteous,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1. It is our advocate, the childrens advocate, believers advocate, and therefore we may come and return unto the father with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er boldneſs.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. Another Note from hence is, <hi>That we are to ſtick cloſe to, and hold faſt that doctrine which was firſt delivered unto the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The church of <hi>Sardis</hi> that was almoſt loſt and dead in her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate and condition, is not commanded by Chriſt to ſeek out any new ways or novel doctrines; but to call to mind and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the old ones which they had formerly received and heard from the faithful Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt: They were not to ſeek after any new diſcovery of light which was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly delivered to them; there was great danger in ſuch ways: They might attain unto the new lights of the Gnoſticks, Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans, and the high ſpeculations thereof, or rather, <hi>the depths of Satan as they ſpeak,</hi> and yet periſh eternally: For the way to life is the good old way diſcovered firſt unto <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, in the promiſed ſeed of the woman, to break the Serpent's head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and more and more manifeſted under the promiſes and the darker types and ſhaddows of the Law, till at laſt it came to its meridian and full diſcovery by the Son of God himſelf, in the Goſpel: And this Doctrine of this Goſpel of Chriſt, was it that <hi>Sardis</hi> was commanded to remember that which ſhe had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received and heard, and to keep cloſe unto it, from which he had made a defection great and foul? This is the ſum of whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Doctrine that we are commanded to keep cloſe unto, and this was that that <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyned <hi>Timothy</hi> to attend unto 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>Continue thou in the things which thou haſt learned and art perſwaded thereof, knowing of whom thou haſt learned them: and that thou hast known the holy Scriptures of a child, which are able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, through the faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The only way that is to reſtore and renew the ſoul that is almoſt dead in ſin, to attain <hi>the new Name, the new Life, the new</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>that cometh down from God,</hi> is to keep cloſe to and hold faſt the old way, the old Doctrine, the old light delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: For all innovations in Doctrines or Worſhip, carry great danger with them.</p>

deſolate the wicked and unrighteous only. Chriſt comes as a Thief in the time of his coming, in the maner of his coming, in the diſpoſition of his coming, it is to deſtroy and ſpoil. When Chriſt ſaid unto the man that had not the Wedding Garment, <hi>Friend how camest thou in hither without thy Wedding Garment? Take him, bind him hand and foot, and caſt him into utter darkneſs.</hi> This was an act of a dreadful Judge, in <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Chriſt eyes and feet were like unto flames of fire;</hi> he had fiery judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his hands againſt his churches, which deſtroyed and diſſolved them for their ſins and tranſgreſſions. It was Chriſt that ſent the miſerable deſolating judgments on the Jews by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and continues it over them until this day: It is Chriſt that ſends the ſword and blood unto the Nations round about, for their iniquities: It is Chriſt that goeth forth on his red Horſe of judgments; to War againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, and all their curſed complices and adherents, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 We may conceive, and conceive amiſs, when we think that it is man that blows theſe coals of War and contentions in the world; but it is Chriſt that doth it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.49. <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth,</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34. <hi>I come not to ſend peace, but a ſword; for I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his Father; and the daughter, againſt her mother; and the daughter in Law, againſt her mother in Law; and a mans foes ſhall be they of his own houſhold:</hi> And this fire hath been kindled among us, and other neighbour Nations; and who is able to put it out unleſs it be Chriſt, to whom pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given to compoſe all our differences and diſſentions; who <hi>hath the Key of</hi> David; <hi>and opens, and no man ſhuts; and ſhuts, and no man opens:</hi> If Chriſt opens the ſluce and door of his deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting judgments, who can ſhut it up, or keep them back? But if he ſhuts the door of his wrathful judgments, and ſets a ſtop unto the current and progreſs of them, who can open it? For it is he alone that can treat War, and all the miſeries thereof, and can again produce the happy fruits of tranquility and peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But if any one ſhould unadviſedly Object, This were an evil to affirm that Chriſt ſends the ſword, and war into the world: or think it harſh that he that is the Lamb of God, ſhould put on ſuch a fiery poſture, abhorrent to his meek and peaceable nature, or ſay it is not ſtrange for the wicked to do this work, or to ſee fire come forth from a bramble, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.15. this were but ordinary; but to ſee fire come out from the Vine, from Chriſt, this is moſt ſtrange and abhorrent to their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I anſwer,</hi> As Chriſt is the Lamb ſlain, ſo alſo he is the Judge of all the earth, and a Judge you know, muſt have his Sheriffs, the Executioners of his Judgments and Sentences: So Chriſt takes the Sword, War, Famine, and Peſtilence, they are the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of Chriſt's Judgments againſt the delinquent wicked ones
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53073:139"/>
of the world, and ſo he uſes them lawfully and juſtly: And for ſuch as will not kiſs the Son, obey him, fear him, and love him, he can be angry with them, though they be the Kings, the great ones, and Judges of the earth: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. Chriſt can raiſe up <hi>Cyrus, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Heathen Kings, and call them his Servants, and make them his Inſtruments to do his works of Judgments againſt his rebellious Prophets, and ſend them forth, as <hi>Ottoman, Mahomet, Selimus,</hi> &amp;c. to be juſt Executioners of Gods wrath upon dead, formal, and luke warm chriſtians; and therefore I ſay unto all ſuch as have but the leaſt ſpark of grace and true life in them, <hi>hold faſt, be watchful and repent, or elſe Chriſt will come upon thee ſuddenly,</hi> as a thief, both with his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular temporal Judgments, and with his eternal alſo.</p>

                  <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>That Chriſtians of the beſt Quality and Name, are under the charge and overſight of their Pastors and Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou haſt a few names in</hi> Sardis: Chriſt is the ſupream ruling, teaching and influencing head over his church; but the Paſtor or Miniſter is the ſubordinate organical head to every particular church: And ſo the hand or eye cannot ſay unto the head, I have no need of thee, a body without a head will be but a trunck unfit for lively motion: So a church without a Paſtor or Miniſter, may be a body, but very liveleſs and uſeleſs unto its operations and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. I can but judge them very immorigerous unto the ſweet and eaſy yoak of Chriſt, that will not endure a Paſtor, an Angel, a Miniſter over them, to precede in all official duties unto the flock of Chriſt: It is unto ſuch that the Holy Ghoſt hath committed the overſight of the flock; and therefore all are to ſubmit unto them, as unto the Lord: For though I ſhould grant many things unto the members in common with their Officers, yet not to be Officers or Paſtors in common with them; for there are none ſuch as Paſtors of Paſtors in the Goſpel of Chriſt, but Paſtors of the flock of Chriſt: And therefore as I could never brook a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs community, or leveling in the churches of Chriſt, all to be Rulers and Teachers, and none to be taught and ruled; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would it comport with truth, according to my judgment, to admit of Paſtors over Paſtors, or one Presbitery over another, no farther then prudence will lead unto, but not of Divine right and equity. It is evident theſe ſeven Aſian churches, and all the other the Primitive Apoſtolical ones, were Paſtoral, Epiſcopal, Independent ones. I think it no Paradox to aſſert, that an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal church may be Independent; for I take ſuch a one to be of Divine right indeed, whilſt the Prelatical Epiſcopal church hath loſt its <hi>jure divino,</hi> by exalting it ſelf beyond Chriſt's bounds, and taking too much upon it.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>That the pure undefiled Saints of Chriſt, are perſons of high eſteem and account with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are men of Name and Quality; God takes notice of them, as men of moſt excellent and eminent ſpirits; all the reſt of <hi>Sardis</hi> beſides them, are but ſuch that had the name that they were living, but are dead: Thoſe are they that <hi>ſhall walk with Chriſt in white; for they are worthy:</hi> All the reſt of the world are

not of the ſame valew with theſe in the ſight of God; for they are thoſe for whom the world was made; yea, God reproves Kings for their ſakes, ſaying, <hi>Touch not mine Anointed,</hi> Pſal. 105.15.

And the great reaſon of this is, in that they have the image and likneſs of God upon them, and his ſpirit dwelling in them, and every thing does love and highly eſteem its like; for likneſs is the root of love, much more God's, who is love it ſelf, will highly eſteem and love his Saints, being the workmanſhip of his own hands.</p>

                     <hi>Even in</hi> Sardis <hi>thou haſt a few Names.</hi> Hence Note,</p>

                     <hi>Sardis</hi> had but the name that ſhow as living, and was dead; and yet in this nominal, dead, formal church, God had a few Names there that were precious to him. The church of God did never totally fail upon the earth, nor never ſhall; though the viſibility thereof may fail, yet the inviſible church will never fail: When all fleſh had corrupted its ways, and wickedneſs of man grown great, and the earth filled with violence, before the Floud, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.11, 12. yet then was <hi>Noah</hi> undefiled, and a faithful Preacher of righteouſneſs; yea he was juſt and perfect in his generation, and walked with God. In the corrupted church ſtate in the days of <hi>Ahab.</hi> when <hi>Jezebel</hi> cut off the Prophets of the Lord, and ſet up Idolatries in the room of them, true worſhip of God, and the godly and righteous, ſo vexed and waſted, that <hi>Elijah</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet thought none but himſelf left in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Even then the Lord tells him there were ſeven thouſand which had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 1.18.</p>
                  <p>In the time when Chriſt came in the fleſh, which was in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding bad and corrupted church ſtate, and in a time when the Jewiſh church was never more corrupt then when he came; yet there was then a <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a <hi>Mary,</hi> a <hi>Zachariah,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> and ſome few others that truly feared God. In the darkeſt and deepeſt night of Popery, there were ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes unto the truth; The Waldenſes, the Abigenſes, Pauperes, Lugdunenſes, &amp;c. of whom ſome of the Popiſh Writers themſelves teſtifie, that they were upright in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and believed aright concerning God; only they blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> So there was a <hi>Huc,</hi> a <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague;</hi> a <hi>Wickliff, Berengarius, Peter de Bruis, Luther, Oecolompadius, Melancthon,</hi> &amp;c. in a time and ſtate bad enough: So here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when the church was exceeding corrupt under the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet then appeared here a <hi>Cartwright, Hooker, Ames, Parker, Bolton, Robinſon, Reynolds, Aynſworth, Baynes,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53073:140"/>
pretious Saints and faithful Witneſſes unto the truths of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>God accepteth the pure and undefiled as worthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>at. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God:</hi> They are thoſe that ſhall walk in white with Chriſt, and inherit the Kingdom with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But if it be demanded, Doth not this aſſert a merit in workes; or that purity in the life doth exact from God in the way of Juſtice, ſome anſwerable compenſation to it.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt, and aſſert, That holineſs or purity of heart is the deſcriptive quality of thoſe that ſhall ſee God; they and they only (of Adult perſons) are accepted by God to that high privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I grant too, that the eternal life of happineſs is ſet forth and given as a prize, as a reward, as a crown to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Saints; ſo in this and the laſt chapter it is often promiſed unto ſuch holy ones under ſuch a notion of a crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but I utterly deny that it hath the leaſt proportion to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, or merit the leaſt in ſtrict Juſtice from God, towards eternal life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe eternal life is the free gift of God, and he giveth it to whom he pleaſeth, <hi>Joh,</hi> 17.2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe Divine Juſtice requires exact obedience, which ſaith that he that is guilty of the breach of one tittle of the Law, is guilty of the tranſgreſſion of the whole: For the beſt Saints being ſo imperfect in their obedience, that they come far ſhort in obtaining any thing at the hands of God in ſtrict Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe our ſanctification and holineſs is the alone work of God's own grace and ſpirit, and therefore improperly ſaid to merit at his own hands. A child may merit from his Father in Juſtice, by his filial obedience, the parent being under a natural Law of compenſation, as well as the child is under the law of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards him: But God our heavenly Father is tied up unto no ſuch Laws, being a free agent, and giveth life to whom he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And therefore Laſtly, Becauſe man hath forfeited his firſt covenant of merit and life by righteouſneſs in <hi>Adam,</hi> and that being made null, God hath inſtituted a moſt gratious one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath freely given eternal life to all his choſen ones; merited by the blood of his Son, and received here in the firſt fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by faith and the ſanctification of the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But here comes the Sophiſtical Ieſuites, and ſay, 'Tis true, in rigor or Iuſtice we cannot merit at God's hands, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give him <hi>quid pro quo;</hi> but in his favorable acceptance we may
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53073:141"/>
give him ſome ſatisfaction, wherein there is a kind of imperfect proportion to divine juſtice, and accepted by God in his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy, as good payment from us; and if you will take it rather in their own words whome they deſigne, and ſay there is either, 1. <hi>Sat is factio Juſticiae, ex rigore Juſticiae, ad abſolutam &amp; perfectam equalitatem quantitatis.</hi> Or, 2. <hi>Acceptationis facti ex gratia donante ad imperfectam aequalitatem proportionis &amp; ex condigno.</hi> The firſt ſatisfaction they deny, but the latter they grant, and aſſert that our own works though imperfect in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to anſwer ſtrict Iuſtice, yet being now dyed in the blood of Chriſt, becomes currant for good payment; and Chriſt having merited to ſet a valew upon them, now they are able to ſtand by themſelves, and merit upon their own account at the hands of God. Theſe are ſome of <hi>Belarmines</hi>'s expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, This diſtinction of ſatisfaction in ſtrict Iuſtice, and ſatisfaction in favorable acceptance; is but vain and ſophiſtical unto this Queſtion: I grant that our good works and holineſs done out of faith, are pleaſing to God and accepted of him; but where doth it appear that God accepts them as the leaſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Iuſtice in Scriptures? God is not like man in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſatisfaction, ready to take twenty Pounds for one hundred Pounds from his debtor, where no more is to be had; God will make no ſuch complemental compoſitions with his debtors: Divine Iuſtice will exact the utmoſt farthing; either it will have full ſatisfaction of the ſinner, or of his ſurety: either of our ſelves, and upon our own perſons, or upon Chriſt for us: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vain to imagine ſuch a facility or partiality in Divine Iuſtice, as to be ſatisfied with a few poor unworthy raggs of our own imperfect righteouſneſs. No ſatisfactions will ſuit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with Divine Iuſtice, but ſuch as are by the ſame Iuſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſufficient, ſuch as are Chriſt's ſatisfactions, and they only can do the work: And therefore thoſe pure undefiled names at <hi>Sardis</hi> are accounted worthy to walk with Chriſt in white, not out of their own merits, or the leaſt ſatisfaction that they can render unto Divine Iuſtice; but out of God's meer gratious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation and free love towards them: They are worthy not out of Merit and Iuſtice, but out of fitneſs, aptneſs, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in compariſon of others: And ſo God accepts them as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, lovely, and worthy to be in his preſence for ever and ever.</p>

                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>The future bleſſed ſtate of the Saints, is not only a ſinleſs innocent one, but a moſt glorious one alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is manifeſted by their ſolemn inveſtiture into that ſtate, being clothed in white rayment, which doth typifie and repreſent, as the Prieſts veſtures of old, both Innocency and Majeſty: and there is all reaſon for it; for, <hi>We are then made both Kings and Prieſts unto our God,</hi> Rev. 5.10. <hi>and we ſhall reigne on earth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And I will not blot out his name out of the book of life.</hi> This is an other addition, or further degree of bleſſedneſs to the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints: The Spirit of God hath taken up this expreſſion of the book of life, and writing in this book, and blotting out of it, from the manner of men, metaphorically borrowed from their practiſe, and is very often uſed in the Scriptures, as in that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 32.32. <hi>I pray thee raze me out of the book which thou haſt written:</hi> and according to that Imprecation of <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 69.28. <hi>Let them be put out of the book of life:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All which do ſignifie, that God hath (as it were) a book of remembrance, according to the practiſe of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he writes and blots out, that the things therein ſignified may be made plain and obvious to our underſtanding. But by the way, we muſt not be ſo groſs, to imagine that God hath a book for the help of his memory, or that he writeth or blotteth out, as men uſually do; God is no ſuch corporeal Being, to uſe ſuch helps: but it is to be underſtood metaphorically, as aboveſaid, and <hi>per Anthropopathean,</hi> according to his condeſcenſion to the capacities of men; as when eyes, face, hearing, hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are aſcribed unto God: He needs not books of writings for help of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or memory, for all things paſt, preſent, and to come, are in his fight. But to underſtand the terms a little more diſtinctly, know, God hath a double book of life, wherein he is ſaid to write and blot out: The one is that of his Decrees of his Election un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life; the other is the book of the execution of thoſe Decrees.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53073:142"/>
In the firſt book, perſons may be ſaid to be written in it two ways, either really, or ſeemingly ſo unto others: for the firſt, they can never be expunged or blotted out of that book, unleſs Divine Omniſcience and Omnipotency ſhould fail, that is engaged for their ſupport and perſeverance; which more fully hereafter ſhall be declared. But the ſecond ſort, that are but ſeemingly written in this book of life in the judgement of others, may be ſaid to be blotted out, and caſt-aways, for in truth they were never really written in it. So alſo in the other book of the execution of Gods decrees, perſons may be ſaid to be written in that alſo two ways. Firſt really and in truth, when God executeth his decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by bringing and receiving his elect ones into the Goſpel covenant by believing, and ſo enrolls them in the number of his faithful ones, church, and family. Secondly, Others alſo may be ſaid to be written in this book, which are but only ſeeming and ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ulary chriſtians, in reſpect they have taken up the profeſſion of the faith, and are added to the church viſible as members thereof, and are ſo juſtly reputed by others, becauſe they have ſubmitted to the ordinances of the church, which is ſufficient, nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to the contrary, to denominate them Saints, called, elect, and written in the book of life.</p>
                  <p>Now when God is ſaid to blot out names (names being put for perſons) out of the book of life, it only ſignifies, that God will manifeſtly declare and make it known, both to the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others, that they never were true members of the church, nor in the ſtate of election and ſalvation, nor never writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will not blot his name out of the book of life.</hi> Under this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive promiſe unto the conquering Saint, is contained a ſtrong Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the continuance of the contrary bleſſing: Chriſt will not only not blot out his name out of the book of life, that is, confirm and continue his undoubted right and title unto eternal life, but he will alſo manifeſtly declare and make known unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his lawful Title and intereſt, according as he hath ordained him thereunto in his book of life from all eternity: and ſo the ſubſequent words do intimate; <hi>I will confeſs his name before my Father, and before his Angels:</hi> often in Scripture things are then ſaid to be done, when they are only manifeſted to be done, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying, <hi>Res tum demum dicuntur fieri cum incipian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur manifeſtari. Reg. Petrum.</hi> As to inſtance by <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> The Spirit in that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture not intending that the Son was not begotten of the Father before that day when that word was uttered, but that on that day he was more eminently declared and manifeſted to be the only begotten Son of God, then formerly: So that when it is ſaid in Scripture, that God will blot their names out of the book of life, it only imports, That God will diſcover to themſelves and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53073:142"/>
others, that their names were never written in the book of life, nor had any right or intereſt at all in election or ſalvation, farther then in the outward appearance. From the words Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That the eternal ſtate of God's choſen ones, is ſealed and ſecured by God from everlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their names are written in the eternal book of God's decrees of life, and he will not blot them out; for being once enrolled in the book of God's election, and among the catalogue of his Saints in the church inviſible, they can never be razed out; for <hi>the foundation of God continueth ſure,</hi> Rom. 9.11. and hath a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſeal, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. Firſt, God's knowledge, whereby he knoweth them that are his. Secondly, His Spirit of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſealeth them unto eternal life. Now if any thing would blot out thoſe that are thus enrolled or written in the book of life, it muſt be their ſins and pollutions that would do it: but the ſins of God's choſen ones, cannot move the Lord to raze us out of his book of life; for, then the fore-ſight and knowledge of our ſins in God's eternal counſel, would much more have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him from chuſing and enrolling us in the book of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſeeing every one knoweth, that a leſs cauſe will hinder the choice of any, then move them to reject the perſon once choſen: nay rather, becauſe the Lord hath choſen us, therefore he will give us his holy Spirit, whereby he will preſerve us (though not altogether from falling into ſin, yet) from finally lying dormant and impenitent therein: and as he hath freely choſen us to eternal life, without any reſpect to our own worthineſs; ſo alſo he will freely execute this decree, by giving us all the good means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome may ſay, Though the conquering Saints are ſecure, and their names ſhall not be blotted out of this book, yet this doth intimate, that others whoſe names are written therein, for their ſinful pollutions and iniquities unrepented of, may be blotted out; according to that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.33. <hi>Whoſoever hath ſinned againſt me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>him will I blot out of my Book.</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. <hi>Let them be put out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, This threatning is not againſt the true members of Chriſt, or his church, who are enrolled in the book of life, but thoſe that are the members of the viſible church only, and are only ſeemingly written in the book of life, members in ſhew, and not in truth; branches in the Vine by profeſſion, but not in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and life; of the Lord's family, and in the number of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in their own, and others opinion, but not really and in truth according to God's eſtimation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas God ſaith he will blot ſuch out of his book; we are not to underſtand thereby, that he would blot them out of the book of his election unto life, wherein they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53073:143"/>
written; or, that he would reject them whom he had choſen: but that he would raze them out of the other book of life, the book of the execution of his decrees, to wit, the book and roll <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f his viſible church: and that it might be manifeſtly declared that they who in their own opinion, and in reſpect of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion in the opinion of others, might ſeem to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in both books, or both parts of the book of life, of that of God's decrees, which only relates to the inviſible members and church of Chriſt; and alſo of that other book or roll of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church, yet were not in truth ever enrolled in either, farther then in outward profeſſion and appearance only.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, Whereas <hi>David</hi> prays, that the obſtinate enemies of God and himſelf, might be put out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous, is no more, but as if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, Do not (O Lord) write them down, or reckon them in the number of thy faithful ones; or, if they come to be numbred among thy church and people, and to be accounted written in the book of the living, in reſpect of their outward profeſſion, and external walking with the people of God, yet diſcover ſuch, and diſplay them, that it may manifeſtly appear that they were never truly written in the book of the living, nor are to be accounted among the righteous, that ſo they may be put out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thy church and children, that all may know that they were but hypocrites. For in regard that God's decree of election is unſearchable to man, thoſe are ſaid to be elected and written in the book of life, who are outwardly called, and added to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church, profeſſing themſelves members thereof, which are the outward, but not the infallible ſigns of God's election, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are common both to hypocrites and ſound believers: and ſo likewiſe God is ſaid to blot perſons out of this book, whoſe ſins and hypocriſies are diſcovered, and ſo thruſt out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the faithful; and therefore <hi>David,</hi> becauſe he would have God's vengeance againſt theſe wicked ones plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, deſireth the Lord to diſcover them, that they have no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, right, or part in the book of the living, nor worthy to be written or numbred among the righteous, but that all might ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly diſcern them to be but reprobates. And thus far <hi>David</hi>'s prayer is imitable, as unto us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But by the way I ſhall put a queſtion, Whether it is lawful or conſonant to the will of God, for any of the Saints of God, to pray to God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32. <hi>I pray thee raze me out of the book which thou haſt written:</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed, <hi>To be ſeparated from Christ for his brethren according to the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 9.3. Or ſecondly, To pray that other mens names, though wicked, may be blotted out of the book of the living, as <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. prayed againſt the enemies of God and himſelf?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not lawful to pray for any thing contrary to the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53073:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
known will of God, for there are no commands or promiſes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to ſuch a prayer, but abundantly to the contrary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely ſuch prayer muſt be moſt vain and ſinful; for neither <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> were bound to prefer the good of their brethren, before the fruition of God, and their own ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> did pray ſo abſolute, but conditionally, like to that of Chriſt, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me:</hi> ſo they, if it would ſtand with God's will, and be approved by him, could deſire and wiſh to be razed out, and anathematized from the roll of God's church, and from life itſelf, ſo that they could deliver their loſt brethren of Iſrael from the curſe and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that hung over them for their infidelity and impenitency: this they did deſire under the loſs of their own ſalvation, had it been poſſible. But whether <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo an eye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in theſe particular prayers to the will of God, is uncertain: for I think it is no ſin to ſay, that either <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> might be carried aſide by an over miſ-led zeal to their brethren the Jews: for, <hi>In many things we ſin all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, cap.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, if <hi>David</hi> did pray unto God abſolutely, that the names of the ungodly might be put out of the book of the living, I think it not warrantable nor Imitable in us. <hi>David</hi> being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and having the ſpirit of propheſie, he well knew againſt whom he prayed, propheſied, and imprecated, and ſo his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and imprecations to this effect, were but as ſo many propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal denunciations, and predictions of God's judgements againſt his impenitent enemies; which are no patterns or examples to us: for we are commanded to pray for all men, even for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the moſt vileſt perſons in the world, as long as there is hope of their returning. But ſecondly, Though we may not pray abſolutely, yet we may conditionally, with ſubmiſſion to God's will, againſt all his, and our antichriſtian enemies, that God would either convert them, or bring them to ſhame and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, that his glory, and the Saints peace and comforts may be more enlarged and multiplyed thereby. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will confeſs his name before my Father, and before his Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt having aſſured the overcoming Saints of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that they ſhould participate of his glory, and be clothed with majeſty in the other world, and having undoubtedly aſſured them the confirmation and continuance of their bleſſed eſtate, and their right thereunto, in not blotting out their names out of his bleſſed roll and regiſter of the book of life; and having promiſed not only to do all this good for them, but will alſo acknowledg them, confeſs them to be his by name, before God and his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; that is, as if Chriſt had ſaid, Thoſe whom I preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, O Father, and thy holy miniſtring Spirits, clothed in white rayment, in innocency and majeſty, and which are from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity regiſtred in thy book, I avouch and acknowledge them to be
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53073:144"/>
of my own name, members of my own body, anointed with the ſame unction and Spirit that I am of, truly chriſtians, faithful followers of me and my doctrine thorow their whole courſe of regeneration, and new life which they have led unto this preſent day. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That Chriſt will not be aſhamed, but will publiquely own and acknowledge his faithful ones at the laſt day, before God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all his holy Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This he promiſes <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. to confeſs and own them before his Father in heaven, who ſhall faithfully confeſs and own him here on earth. Chriſt calls ſuch here his ſheep, his friends, his brethren, his members, yea himſelf, by his own name, <hi>Chriſt;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. and therefore Chriſt tells them <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>I aſcend to your Father, and my Father, to my God, and your God.</hi> And ſeeing God and Chriſt are not aſhamed to be called their God, and their Chriſt in this life, ſurely in the life to come they will not be aſhamed of them, but will acknowledge them to be the the godly, or God-like chriſtians, that faithfully owned God and Chriſt in their ſeveral generations.</p>
                  <p>This is a great motive and encouragement unto us, boldly, and with conſtancy, in the worſt of times, and under the greateſt defections, to confeſs and own ſo worthy a Lord and Maſter as Chriſt and his ways, ſeeing we ſhall be no loſers by it, but rather great gainers; for before God and his Angels he will not ſpare by name to confeſs us, and to honour us as his own before ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a preſence, although of our ſelves we be moſt unworthy creatures. Who ever truly honoured God and Chriſt in an open ſincere profeſſion, and following of their ways of truth, and was not honoured both by God and Chriſt? <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly esteemed?</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. If we only loſe our honour among men for our profeſſion, and among the baſeſt and vileſt ſort (for all ſcornful ungodly ones are ſo to be accounted, be they never otherwiſe in the eye of the world ſo great, rich, mighty or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and win honour with God; if we be vilified on earth, and among earthly minded men, and be accepted in heaven, we have no cauſe to be diſcouraged, or murmure at our loſs. When Chriſt owned <hi>Stephen</hi> from heaven in the midſt of his enemies, it was more then a ſufficient recompence for his ſtoning, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. What loſs did the three children ſuſtain when they kept their conſciences undefiled, by not obeying <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in worſhipping his golden Image, but openly profeſſing, and praying with their windows open to the God of Iſrael? <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. Did not the Lord for this their faithful honouring of him, honour them with his preſence, with ſafety and deliverance, and made them ever-living examples to all that truly fear God, to truſt in him for help in all extremities that fall on them for his names ſake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:53073:144"/>But if it be asked, How we ſhall honour God faithfully this way?</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, we muſt (as thoſe few undefiled names, or Saints of <hi>Sardis</hi>) overcome the corruptions and pollutions of the times, by witneſſing againſt them, and openly ſtand for, and profeſs the contrary truths and ways of God, and follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If a man purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſsel unto honour, ſanctified, and meet for the Masters uſe.</hi> And therefore let the underſtanding chriſtian mark and conſider this, as it is in the advice of the Spirit in the immediate ſubſequent verſe.</p>

                  <p>But by what warrant M. <hi>Brightman</hi> does this, or why he is ſo luxuriant in his applications, I know not; and I conceive, under due reſpect to ſo learned an Author as M. <hi>Brightman,</hi> that it is beſide the intention of the Spirit, that ever thoſe ſeven Aſian churches ſhould typifie or repreſent any other churches, or ſtate of churches that ſhould riſe in futurity; only they are left unto us, and to all ages to come, as examples and patterns, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know the dealings of God with them; that if we be partakers in the ſame graces with them, we ſhall have the ſame encouragements, approbation, and reward as they had; but if we be found guilty of the ſame tranſgreſſions as they were, we ſhall fall under the ſame judgements as they did; and that that made M. <hi>Brightman</hi> thus over-free in his applications in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpanes, I verily believe to be the variety of conditions both good and had, found in thoſe ſeven churches, which by a good wit, may be ſtretch'd out to repreſent the condition and ſtate of any church whatſoever, which is not altogether beſide the ſcope or intention of the Spirit in them: for it is often inculcated in this and the former chapter, <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the churches.</hi> What was written unto them, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for themſelves, but for the cognizance of all others in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo, coming under the ſame conditions and qualifications with themſelves. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that is holy, he that is true,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words contain a deſcription of Chriſt, who ſends this Epiſtle to the Angel of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> whoſe two firſt properties are taken out of the nature of the Son of God, to wit, Holineſs and truth: Chriſt makes this diſcovery of himſelf, ſutable to the condition of the church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which was an eminent ſhining ſtar, both for the profeſſion of the truth, and for holineſs: to the other the more delinquent churches, he diſcovers himſelf in another poſture, <hi>with eyes and feet like burning braſs, and with a two edged ſword proceeding out of his mouth:</hi> but with the gracious he appears more gracious, and to the truly godly he appears in his own proper nature, in Truth and Holineſs. Hence Note</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>Chriſt diſcovers himſelf unto his people, not only as the holy One, but as the God of Truth alſo. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. Theſe things ſaith he that is holy, he that is true.</hi> They are much deceived that aim at holineſs without the truth. They that own not Chriſt according to the truth, can never be truly holy ones, or ſanctified perſons; for truth ſanctifies; <hi>John</hi> 17.17. Let
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53073:145"/>
their actions be never ſo highly eſtimated in the eye of the world, as proceeding from holy ſelf-denying perſons, yet if they be not done in the truth, that is, from a true fountain, and to right ends, they will loſe their reward, and be at beſt but as tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals. What profit doth it yeild the monaſtical Votaries of <hi>Rome</hi> when they devote themſelves to ſo rigid auſterities, and pretend ſo high to holineſs, whiles they have baniſhed truth from their borders, when neither their ends nor their aims are right accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the truth of God's word? To what end is the Quakers auſtere carriage, and outward holineſs, whileſt they deny Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or Satisfaction by the blood of Chriſt? Will their inherent holineſs, or their auſtere upright carriage, ſerve inſtead of Chriſt's imputed righteouſneſs? Holineſs and truth muſt go together to denominate a true Saint. Heathen Philoſophers will quite out-ſtrip the beſt of chriſtians in divers acts of vertue; but when proceeding from a chriſtian according unto truth, they are to be called by another name; holy or godly actions. If you try the doctrines of men only by the holineſs of the perſons that brings them, you may entertain errors inſtead of truth; for truth is not always with the moſt ſeeming holieſt men: But if doctrines come from perſons holding the truth in ſincerity, and profeſſing the ſame truth in purity and integrity of their ſouls, doubtleſs ſuch doctrines in their firſt origen were from heaven, and not from men. Hence it is that the Spirit of God is not only called the holy Spirit, but alſo the Spirit of Truth, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. becauſe it leadeth and guideth into all truth: and whereſoever the Spirit cometh, as a holy Spirit, to ſanctifie, it cometh in the firſt place as a Spirit of Truth, to lead the ſoul into the ways of truth. If Chriſt makes any diſcoveries unto thy ſoul, it will be as unto <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia,</hi> as the holy One, and as the true One: As he is the way unto holineſs, ſo <hi>he is the way, the truth, and the life; and no man cometh unto the Father, but in, by, and thorow him, John</hi> 14.6.</p>

                     <hi>Which hath the Key of David, that openeth, and no man ſhuteth; and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words have relation to that propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah, cap.</hi> 22. 20. 22. about the calling of <hi>Eliakim</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hilkiah,</hi> who ſhould be a Father unto Jeruſalem, and to the houſe of Judah, into whoſe hands the Government ſhould be committed; and in verſ. 22. <hi>The Key of the Houſe of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder (ſaith the Lord) ſo he ſhall open, and no man ſhall ſhut; and he ſhall ſhut, and none ſhall open.</hi> This <hi>Eliakim</hi> in the days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was his chief Steward, or maſter of his houſhold, as appears by 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.18, 26. and it ſeems by the tranſactions between him and <hi>Senacharib,</hi> none were ſuffered to go in or out to treat with <hi>Senacharib,</hi> but <hi>Eliakim,</hi> and whom he did approve of; he was a man in great authority with the King, and carried the Key and Soveraignty ever his whole houſhold; and therefore he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53073:146"/>
of by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to come, or to be called again of God, not in perſon, but in his antitype and true counterpane, Jeſus Chriſt, the true <hi>Eliakim,</hi> who beareth the Keys of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt may well be typified by <hi>Eliakim,</hi> and to be called the ſpiritual <hi>Eliakim</hi> promiſed in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. both for his name and nature: <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akim</hi> ſignifying (as <hi>Hierom de interpretatione nominum</hi>) the God of the Reſurrection, or God that roſe again: and who was this true <hi>Eliakim</hi> but Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>In the next place, Chriſt was deſcended from this <hi>Eliakim, Luke</hi> 3.30. therefore rightly brought by the Spirit in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to typifie him forth.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, and chiefly, Chriſt is the true ſpiritual <hi>Eliakim,</hi> in reſpect of his Kingly office and Soveraignty which he beareth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his ſpiritual houſe, his church, as <hi>Eliakim</hi> bore it over the houſe of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Key is put metonymice, the enſign of Authority, for Authority it ſelf: But why <hi>the Key of</hi> David, and not <hi>the Key of the Houſe of</hi> David? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.22.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Either it is to be taken metonimically, the Maſter being put for the Houſe, or elſe for the more excellency of this Key that Chriſt bears before that of <hi>Eliakim</hi>'s, the truth it ſelf exceeding the Type: <hi>Eliakim</hi> was but an inferior Miniſter, as the Steward, and that in the family of <hi>David;</hi> but Chriſt he bore the Key of <hi>David,</hi> that is, that was born before or by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelf, due unto the higheſt Governour, and extending to the whole Kingdom. And therefore excels that of <hi>Eliakim</hi>'s, being limitted only to the houſhold of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why is the Key of <hi>David</hi> brought by the Spirit to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt's Soveraignty and Kingdom over his church?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, for divers reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God promiſed an everlaſting Kingdom to <hi>David,</hi> and therefore a fit Type of the church of Chriſt, who are loved with the everlaſting and ſure mercies of <hi>David.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>David</hi>'s Kingdom was over the Iſrael of God; ſo Chriſt over the true Iſrael of God according to the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>David</hi> was an abſolute Lord over his Kingdom, he ſuffered no Jebuſites nor Canaanites to domineer within his Realm and Jurisdiction: ſo Chriſt within the verge of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Sovereignty, he ſuffers no unclean Canaanite to rule and reigne, nor any unclean thing to enter therein; but he will be ſole Lord and Soveraign within his Houſe, as was <hi>David,</hi> and therefore in the next words it is ſaid, <hi>That openeth, and no man ſhutteth; and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi> The ſame Key that openeth, the ſame Key ſhutteth: Chriſt's Key, Power, or Authority, doth open and ſhut in a threefold reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It opens the true Doctrine of Salvation and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt, that none ever hereafter ſhall ſhut it up, or obſcure
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53073:146"/>
it; and again, he ſhuts it up to many unworthy and impenitent people, which none, but by him, ſhall be able again to open and diſcover.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It opens and ſhuts in reſpect of the Government and Soveraignty that Chriſt bears over his Kingdom, his holy Temple and Church, either in admiſſion or excluſion of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Zeah.</hi> 6.12. and herein no man can open or ſhut, admit or exclude, but as Chriſt hath laid down the rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections thereunto in his word.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It opens and ſhuts into Chriſt's hidden, myſtical, and everlaſting Kingdom, the church of the Elect and inviſible Saints, and to whom Chriſt doth open to enter herein, no man can ſhut, and to whom Chriſt ſhutteth, no man can ever open: ſo abſolute a Lord is Chriſt in the whole work and adminiſtration of his Kingdom, that what he does, no man can undo or hinder, and what he will not have done, none can bring to paſs; <hi>He openeth, and no man ſhutteth; and ſhutteth, and no man openeth.</hi> From the words thus explicated,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That Chriſt is the ſole abſolute Lord, ſoveraign Giver, and Diſpoſer of all the bleſſings relating unto his Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is a Lord by power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. 2. He is a Lord by purchaſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.20. 3. He is a Lord by conqueſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.30. 4. He is a Lord by donation, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 2.8. 5. He is a Lord by election, as from God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And doubtleſs ſuch a Lord hath an abſolute power over all the Miniſtrations of his Kingdom, to promote, execute, or hinder as he pleaſeth. The magiſtrate walks not in this ſphere, he hath another Kingdom to deal with; the Magiſtrate cannot here ſhut nor open, though <hi>Erastus</hi> vainly dreamt the contrary. Chriſt's Key, or the Key of <hi>David,</hi> only fits this lock. As the ſpiritual Key of <hi>David</hi> cannot open or ſhut in the civil kingdoms of the world, neither can their civil keys open or ſhut in the ſpiritual houſe of <hi>David,</hi> being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for another lock; and who proves the contrary, diſorders the whole lock, and brings always ruine inſtead of bleſſing upon the experiencers thereof. <hi>Chriſt</hi> fits not upon <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Throne, nor <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon his: Each muſt remember and keep their place and ſtation. If Chriſt open with his Key, and receive into his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdom, <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath no key to ſhut out: If Chriſt ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath no key to open. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Caeſar</hi> may ſhut the door to true Saints, and open it to the debauched world, and ſo make an Image like to that of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s, whoſe feet were partly iron, partly clay: But when Chriſt in his Miniſtery opens and ſhuts, there is ſuch an excellent Image erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like the firſt part of that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.32. <hi>Whoſe Head was of fine gold, his Breaſt and Arms of ſilver.</hi> It was a notable and noble ſaying of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour, unto the Paſtors and Biſhops of his time, <hi>Vos eſt is in Eccleſia, ſed ego extra Eccleſiam Epiſcopus.</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:53073:147"/>
Though he was the great champion of the church, and the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians temporal Saviour, yet he would not meddle with opening or ſhutting in Chriſt's church, nor extort the Key of <hi>David,</hi> or Chriſt's, out of their hands to whom Chriſt left it; for what is done by them, is done by Chriſt, as by his delegated power; what they binde in earth, is bound in heaven; and what they looſe on earth, is looſed in heaven. Chriſt will not ſuffer any to weild his Keys, but thoſe to whoſe hands he hath committed them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own method and way of directions: who uſes them contrary to this, they will find them Scorpions in their hands, ready to bite and deſtroy them, inſtead of healing and curing. Remember the example of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and tremble, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. Was it not the downfal to Popery, when Spiritual men turned Layicks, and Biſhops became Princes? And on the other ſide, Secular Princes handled the Spiritual Keys, opened and ſhut as they pleaſed; made Laws, Edicts, and Rules unto the church, which was Chriſts and his churches prerogative only? What undid our late Epiſcopal hierarchy in <hi>England,</hi> but mixing ſacred things with profane, making Chriſt's and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Laws all one? The Biſhop, he was made a temporal Lord, to act in the Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and civil affairs of the Nation; and in requital hereof, the ſupreme Magiſtrate, he is made ſupreme Head of the church, to enact what Laws he pleaſeth, as in reference to the church, and to open and ſhut to whom he wil, by his high courts of Delegates and high commiſſion, &amp;c. ſuch a church, ſuch a head; a civil church, a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil head: ſuch a church, ſuch laws, ſuch officers, ſuch keys, ſuch pow-Ar: all prudentials, and all of the preſent worlds wiſdom and fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating; and therefore not ſtrange that the fabrick laſted no longer, but fell wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in few ages after the firſt ſtructure thereof. And is it not now to be feared, that the church amongſt us may be lulled aſleep, as in the lap of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by over-much indulgence and temporal honours caſt upon her, and her Miniſters? Though I am not an enemy to their juſt maintenance and temporal comforts, yet I am jealous of them, that all is not Lamb-skin that appears ſo about them, but that ſomwhat (if not too much) of the Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es tayl lies undiſcovered within: What means elſe the bleatings of the cattle? I mean, their preſſing after preferments, extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to their churches, as Heads of Univerſities, State-chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, great Parſonages, Commiſſioners and Tryers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo by reaſon of the want of Chriſt's own Key, do often open to perſons againſt whom Chriſt hath ſhut, and ſhut againſt ſome to whom Chriſt hath opened. So fallible are men that open with the wooden key of their own Politiques: the Lord deliver our Soveraign Magiſtrate from the ſnares of theſe ſpiritual Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians, or Machiavilian Doctors, that do teach the Magiſtrate to lay his Politiques as rules to Chriſt's church; that would have him open, where Chriſt ſhuts; and ſhut, where Chriſt opens. It
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53073:147"/>
is equally dangerous unto both Magiſtrate and Miniſter, to move or act out of their own proper ſpheres; but acting in their own Orbs, the one in his Civil Government and State, the other in his Spiritual policy and church, ſo both becomes gracious and honourable in their reſpective governments and dominions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But what? Shall not chriſtian Magiſtrates do nothing in the church, or execute no part of their Authority therein, which God hath given them for the good of the church?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Firſt, The Magiſtrate may exerciſe his authority for the good of the church in ſeveral reſpects,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In protecting, encouraging, and countenancing the church in the ſervice of Chriſt, and defending their liberty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo become Nurſing Fathers unto the church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As Chriſt does approve and command obedience from all to Magiſtrates, and their Laws, as for God's ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. So Magiſtrates ſhould approve and command Chriſt's Laws and Government to be obſerved of all within their reſpective boundaries and jurisdictions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If any proves turbulent, ſeditious, or factious in the church, under pretence of liberty, and ſo become a peace-breaker in the Commonweal, the Magiſtrate may reſtrain him by his civil power.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If any church member become a blaſphemer, an idolater, an open delinquent againſt the firſt Table, or tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the ſecond, the Magiſtrate may chaſtiſe him for it, over and above the cenſure of the church; not as required thereunto by the church, but by vertue of his own civil Laws, that equally reaches all perſons that tranſgreſs them, whether Eccleſiaſtiques or others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly in the Negative, I anſwer, That Magiſtrates have nothing to do, nor are competent Judges, as Magiſtrates, of controverſal points, opinions, doctrines, or of things meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relating to the church; Chriſt never endued the Magiſtrate with ſuch a power: Therefore the argument is very prevalent a Negative, That they have no ſuch power. The church alone (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt) is endued with that power of trying doctrines, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing errors in opinions and judgements, according to the rule of the Word. Now to whom this rule was given, the foreſaid power was given; but the rule was committed to the church only, and not to Magiſtrates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. therefore the ſaid power of trying doctrines, and ſuppreſſing errors, was committed only to the church, and not to Magiſtrates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But may not Magiſtrates ſuppreſs errors, and uſe their authority to that end, when they are thereunto well adviſed by a Learned Aſſembly of Divines, or able Miniſters of the church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Miniſters of Chriſt, if they be ſuch adviſers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53073:148"/>
do firſt betray their truſt and calling in their Maſter's ſervice, into the hands of the Magiſtrate, plainly acknowledging, that their Lord and Maſter hath not provided an Armory ſufficient in his Houſe and Kingdom to overthrow errors, as well as means for their diſcovery. Is not this to run for carnal weapons, whilſt they lay by thoſe made by God, ſpiritual ones, <hi>and mighty through God, to pull down Powers, Principalities, and all the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If Magiſtrates act thus upon the advice of others, they muſt not only ſee with other mens eyes, and act upon an implicite faith, but do alſo hereby become but the executioners of their Aſſemblies Decrees: What more doth the Popiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they execute the Edicts of the Romiſh conclave? And what otherwiſe did <hi>Pilate,</hi> when he became the executioner of the Prieſts ſentence upon Chriſt, in crucifying him? A Sea-mark to all to take notice on this account.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Magiſtrates, as Magiſtrates, are not to ſuppreſs er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, becauſe Chriſt hath other Laws, Ordinances, and Ways to ſuppreſs them, then what Magiſtrates, as ſuch, can take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. and by thoſe Laws in the Apoſtles and Primitive times were errors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and puniſhed, and not by the Laws of Magiſtrates, there was no appealing unto <hi>Ceſar</hi> for this work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome Eraſtianizing, or rather ſycophantizing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of theſe days, that are willing and ready to gratifie the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate with a boon more then is juſtly due unto him, comes and objects: Is not the Magiſtrate ſubordinate, as unto Chriſt as Mediator, to make Laws for him, and to rule next and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate under him in his church?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed this objection was of ſome weight, when by Act of Parliament <hi>Henry</hi> 8. was made Supreme Head of the church, and whilſt the ſound thereof was continued down to his Succeſſors, even till ten years ſince, in the conſtant publique pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for a bleſſing on the chief Magiſtrate, under the Title of the Supreme Head of the church, next and immediate under Chriſt: Then I ſay this objection was ſomwhat; but now it is judged to ſavour of too much levity and oſtentation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, But to anſwer more fully. I grant that all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are ſubordinate unto Chriſt, not only by the law of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and gubernation, by which (as God) he rules the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe; but alſo, by the law of Redemption, and his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſo <hi>by him Kings reigne, and decree juſtice.</hi> If Chriſt had not died, there had been no King or Subject in the whole world: There's a common temporal ſalvation attain'd for all by the death of Chriſt; all had ſo died, if Chriſt had not died. Many have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the death of Chriſt this way in a temporal ſalvation, which ſhall never taſte the benefit of Chriſt's death ſavingly, or eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53073:148"/>
Chriſt is a Saviour of all, but eſpecially of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. So I ſay, all Soveraign Authorities in the world, have a being by vertue of Chriſt's death and Mediatorſhip, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that purchaſe, are ſubordinate unto him, holding their Kingdoms and Principalities, as in chief from him; for all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given unto him as a reward of his ſufferings, and the travels of his ſoul, both in heaven and in earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over the Saints militant and tryumphant; and in earth, over all Powers and principalities thereof. So that Chriſt hath at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a two-fold kingdom and people to govern and rule; the one is of the world, and the Nations thereof, which now he governs and rules only providentially, by placing Kings and Princes over them, to rule and reigne next and immediate under him, by laws which the Legiſlators conceive moſt conducing to the well-being of their States and Kingdoms: and herein Chriſt's concurrence is no more but in common providence and preſervation, which he exerciſes equally towards all the works of his creation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. But he hath another Kingdom and people to rule and govern, which are a ſpiritual people, his church, which were the main and principal purchaſe of his death: Chriſt hath another eye, a more diſtinguiſhing reſpect to thoſe then to the others, and therefore more eſpecially he provides for them, to reigne and rule over them with ſpecial and peculiar Laws, ſuiting to their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conditions; not that Chriſt exempts them from the wholſome temporal laws of Magiſtrates, but that he ſuits them laws and ordinances fit for his own body, whereof he himſelf is Head, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluendo &amp; infundendo:</hi> And for this ſpiritual body and oeconomy, Chriſt hath his Laws, his Ordinances, and his ſubordinate Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which are for the perfecting of the body, till all come to the unity of the faith, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. And amongſt the whole catalogue of Chriſt's Officers, we can find no mention of King, Prince, or Parliament, that are ordained to ſuch a work, and therefore ſure their work is another work then to make Laws for ſo ſpiritual a people as Chriſt's church is; they are to hear no other voice but their maſters, nor to derogate ſo far from their ſpiritual Head, Lord, and Soveraign, as to ſuffer any to reigne and rule over them in this ſpiritual oeconomy, but him alone who hath his Laws, his Ordinances, his Officers, to which they muſt obey, and he ſubſtitutes none next and immediate under him in this his diſpenſatory Kingdom of Grace, but his Vicar general, the holy Spirit, which doth virtuate all his holy Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances unto their ends: And therefore ſuch Powers of the world as go about as ſubordinate to Chriſt, to make and impoſe Laws on the church of Chriſt, ſhould as ſoon attempt to give Laws and Ordinances to the Stars of heaven; for though they are creatures of this world, yet too high for their laws to reach: ſo are the other
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53073:149"/>
Stars, God's churches, for they are from heaven, and born from above, neither are they of this world: and therefore, how vain and abſurd it is, for the Magiſtracy of this world to make laws and rules for them that have their converſation in heaven, and live in another world: they live in heaven, and by heavenly laws they are governed; their life is hid with God in Chriſt, and Chriſt's Edicts they only hear and follow: They live in a ſpiritual bleſſed ſtate, and nothing but ſpiritual Laws will they hearken to: Their lot is fallen into an <hi>Utopia,</hi> and none but <hi>Utopian</hi> laws ſhall be their rules: But if they fall as men let the laws of men take hold upon them: Though man cannot make Laws ſutable to the Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, yet it the Saints tranſgreſs the wholeſom Ordinances of man, they ſhall juſtly ſuffer as men, and not as Saints; for, in things honeſt and indifferent, the canon is univerſal: <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers,</hi> whether Saint or other, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give God his due, and <hi>Ceſar</hi> his.</p>

And this door is opened, when mens hearts are opened, as was <hi>Lidias,</hi> ready to receive the truth revealed by the Spirit of Truth. The church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> may be ſaid to have this double door open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a free power given her by Chriſt to preach the Goſpel, and ready and willing hearts to receive it, which no man ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to take away from her: for it is the great Key-bearer of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelf that hath opened it; and maugre all the malice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and wicked men in their helliſh deſigns, it can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured and ſhut up more.

What a large door hath Chriſt laid open ſince the firſt days of reformation, to this preſent day? This could never be attained unto by the power of man, but by Chriſt, who by weak and deſpicable things and perſons, hath confounded the wiſe and mighty of the antichriſtian world: as <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, conſider with what weapons I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome their errors, I have never touched them with a finger, but Chriſt hath deſtroyed them all with the Spirit of his mouth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the word of his Goſpel. What doings, what impriſonings, what finings, what puniſhments, what tortures, what puniſhments, what deaths did the old Popiſh Doctors and clergy, and of late, the prelatical Biſhops raiſe and invent to ſhut up this door that Chriſt had opened to his faithful witneſſes in this land? and yet, what did they prevail and get thereby, but by daſhing themſelves againſt the corner ſtone, and by endeavouring to ſuffocate and ſhut up the true light, became themſelves the children of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and broke themſelves to pieces againſt the corner ſtone, and became the ſcorn of the whole world?

So among chriſtians there are two ſorts that wound this honourable name of chriſtians, who call themſelves chriſtian churches, and are not, but do wrong and blaſpheme the honourable name of church and chriſtians; I mean the Romiſh Popiſh Synagogue, and many of the pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches: The firſt like the Iews of old cry out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord! The Temple of the Lord! O, The Church! The holy Catholique Church! The Chaire of</hi> Peter! <hi>The infallible Chair of</hi> Peter! We are the only Spouſe of Chriſt, no ſalvation without our juriſdiction, and yet who greater blaſphemers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachers, and perſecutors of the true chriſtian churches and Saints then they? And ſeeing they will not part with the Title of the church, let them keep it; but is ſuch a one as is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the church or Synagogue of Satan, not of Chriſt; and as long as their Idolatries continue, ſhe will ever be a <hi>Babel,</hi> not a <hi>Bethel,</hi> counterfeit Iews, no real ſpiritual ones, chriſtians only in Title and ſhew, not in truth, notwithſtanding all their high pretentions and claimes to the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. So many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reformed chriſtians cry out, We are of the reformation we are baptiſed, we are of the Lutheranes confeſſion, we are of the Calviniſts; and yet no Papiſt more blind, more ignorant, more vile, more profane, or greater enemies to Chriſt in the power of godlineſs. The names titles and honour of chriſtians they love, they eſteem, they expect; and yet who vainer, who more profane, more ungodly, or leſs deſerve it then they? They are only nominal chriſtians, outward Iews; but to the inward ſpiritual Iew, who more ſtrangers to it then they: Let them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look to it notwithſtanding their high and honourable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected titles, leaſt the ſpirit of God ſhall declare the very truth, and manifeſt to all true chriſtians, that they are only ſeeming Iews, and do lye when they call themſelves ſo, and that they are not of the true chriſtian church, but of the Synagogue of Satan.

Or when did ever God make it it eminently appear to them, that the chriſtian churches were the only beloved people and ſocietys in the eye of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others in the world? Seeing thoſe things were never yet acompliſhed according to the fulneſs of this promiſe, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is yet a time to come, when there ſhall be a more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal call of the Iewiſh Synagogue into holy <hi>Philadelphia</hi> or the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church, then ever yet have been to this preſent day.

                  </p>
                  <p>This is confirmed from this verſe, wherein it is promiſed by Chriſt that the obſtinate Iews ſhould come in and worſhip before the feet of the church of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> but towards <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in the latter, this was never as yet performed in the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of this Scripture, as is above manifeſted, therefore as yet to come to paſs before the feet of the true <hi>Philadelphia</hi> the holy church of Chriſt: And not only the natural Iews ſhal come in, ſubmit and joyn to the holy church of Chriſt; but al formal birth chriſtians ſhall alſo either come in and worſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

And it is but juſt that God's true church and people ſhould have a day too, as well as their adverſaries had theirs. We know how that the great and lofty ones of the world, have put all poſſible reproaches and afflictions on the Saints of God, and churches of the pureſt judgment; but yet the time is at hand that they ſhall be convinced, and ſhall know the Saints to be the only beloved of God, and the great intereſt and ſtay of Kingdomes, and then the greateſt Monarch will be glad to take hold on the skirt of a Jew to come under the protection of this holy church, for their God is the Lord of Hoſts.</p>

                  <p>That for which <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is commended for by Chriſt, is for keeping the word of his patience: This hath either reſpect to Chriſt, or unto the church; as if Chriſt had ſaid, becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, that is, the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which with a great deal of patience I have taught the world and with a like patience Preached it from time to time; or elſe the effect being put for the cauſe, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience,</hi> that is, the word of my Goſpel, which enjoineth and worketh patience: Either or both of theſe ſenſes may aptly be raiſed and entertained from theſe words, without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice unto the truth and intention of the Spirit in theſe words. or, 2. as reſpecting the Church of <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> This word as it was

the word of Chriſt's patience which he taught patiently, the word is, for many generations; ſo it was received and kept by her with patience and conſtancy; for which ſhe had the reward of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept from the hour of temptation.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How then is it ſaid here that ſhe is kept or ſaved from this hour of temptation?</p>

                  <p>Secondly, That though it ſhould come upon them, yet they ſhould not ſuffer or quail under it, but ſhould overcome the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or calamity manfully, by receiving ſtrength from Chriſt to undergo it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That though they ſhould ſuffer under this hour of tryal, yet it ſhall not ſo reach them as to undo their eternal ſtate and condition; this is ſealed, ſecured, and kept ſafe by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are ſaved and delivered from this hour of temptation, comparatively as unto others, there is no more laid upon them then they are able to bear, it is but an hour, a taſte of affliction, whiles others paſs under ten burning days of tryals. In theſe three latter ſenſes <hi>Philadelphia</hi> may be ſaid to be kept ſafe from the hour of temptation, either from failing under it, or looſing by it in their eternal eſtate, or comparatively unto others; Hence Note,</p>

by God, and not one of them ſhall be loſt, but ſhall be gathered and made up as his Jewels, from out of the Aſhes of the world.

O the goodneſs of our God, who hath a ſpecial care of us, and eye towards us in the common calamities of the world, who will either preſerve us as Iſrael in a <hi>Goſhen,</hi> or as Chriſt himſelf was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Herods</hi> of the world doe wrack their curſed malice upon the Infants of <hi>Judea</hi> for Chriſt's ſake: And ſo our temptation will be but for an hour as reſpecting others; and if it reaches us fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſeizes our perſons, and the relations moſt dear unto us, be aſſured and know it is but an hour of temptation, and we ſhall be delivered from it, and become more then conquerors through Chriſt. Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> on this verſe (that makes the reformed church according to <hi>Calvine,</hi> the counterpane of this of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi>) that the reformed church, aſſerts, the conterpane, as the type formerly had, is to have an hour of temptation, a more grievous affliction, far above all others, yet a ſhort one, and is to come to paſs by the Romiſh Antichriſt in the Weſt, and the Turkiſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometane in the Eaſt; but yet herein the church ſhall get the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And I am thus far of opinion with Maſter <hi>Brightman,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Battel of Almighty God and deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the true church of Chriſt ſhall more eminently and ſignally be ſlain and trod under foot by her Antichriſtian enemies, then at preſent ſhe is: For this is the day of ſtriving and only of indeavour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to bring forth, and Antichriſt ſtill hinders and prevails; for it was given him all the time of his raign to make War with the Saints and to prevail, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7. but before the end of his raign, and about the finiſhing the Teſtimony of the faithful witneſſes of Chriſt, the Beaſt that aſcendeth out of the Bottomleſs Pit, and ſhall make war againſt them, and not only overcome them, but kill them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.7, 8. &amp;c. <hi>And their dead bodies ſhall ly in the ſtreet of the great City for three days and a half,</hi> as the reproach and ſcorn of all their enemies; and the expectancy of this ſignall day of affliction over the churches of Chriſt before the utter overthrow
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53073:154"/>
of the Antichriſtian Beaſt, it far more conduces to the good of the churches of Chriſt, then an over-haſty expectancy thereof, that every one may be prepared by faith and holineſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unmovable in that day, it being ſtill the uſual Method of Chriſt, after great and ſignal calamities and afflictions, to come with ſalvation joy and reſt unto the church of God; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the way of the croſs, entered into his glory: Therefore you Saints think it not ſtrange when ſuch an hour of temptation cometh over you, Chriſt will ſave and keep you from it, and ye ſhall be conquerors at the laſt, and ſhall raign on earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11. To proceed to the next words,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which ſhall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</hi> This hour of temptation that was to come upon all the world, is not to be underſtood of all the world indefinitely, but in a limited ſenſe, as that, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only Son</hi> &amp;c. that is, the world, that Chriſt died for his holy church and members; for it is evident (whatſoever the Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n and Univerſaliſt ſaith to the contrary) that by the world here is meant the churches of Chriſt, diſperſed in <hi>Aſia</hi> and elſe where; for Chriſt never ſends a day or hour of tryal on the wicked world for what need he ſo to do; for they are neither regenerate, nor under grace, and therefore have no graces to make tryal of, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of quickning, ſtrengthening, or confirming; ſo that when Chriſt promiſes to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> that he <hi>will keep her from the hour of temptation which ſhall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth,</hi> is no more in effect, but as if Chriſt had ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will keep thee from the hurt and danger of the hour of temptation which ſhall come upon all the chriſtian churches in the world, for the tryal of their faith and conſtancy in all the quarters of the earth. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That not any of Christ's churches are exempted from tryals and temptations:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the great reaſon of this is, that the church moſt thrives and grows this way; it is obſerved a Lily among Thorns grows faireſt and largeſt; and it was anciently ſaid, that the blood of the Martyrs was the ſeed-plot of the church; the more times that gold is refined by the Refiners fire, the more ductible and ſolid it becomes: So Chriſt's churches, the more tryals they go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the more eminent and reſplendent they become in grace: In the day of affliction under Biſhops and Prelates, more true godlineſs did appear, then at preſent, in the day of proſperity and peace. A beloved child never ſcapes without a rod from his Father when he offends; neither a true church from Gods fatherly tryals and chaſtiſements; <hi>for in ſome things we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all,</hi> and the beſt hath their <hi>maculae,</hi> their ſpots, droſs, and defections, to be purged from, therefore not ſtrange when we fall into diverſe tryals; by this we know that we are not baſtards,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53073:154"/>
but ſons beloved of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>And all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to thoſe that fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. Another Note hence is, <hi>That the greateſt hour of calamity and temptation that comes upon the world, is but a tryal unto the godly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Temptations unto the wicked are God's Judgments towards them, they are the executioners of his wrath and juſtice; He deſtroys the wicked in his fiery indignation: But unto the godly they are only for their tryal, ſtrengthning, and bettering. To one God gives riches, honour, preferment, &amp;c., as a mercy; to the other they become ſnares unto, and deſtructive. So alſo on the godly, as on <hi>Job,</hi> God ſends the plundering Sabaeans, as a tryal of their patience; on the other, as the executioners of his wrath: Sword, famine, or death, that equally ſweeps away both, yet unto the one, they are but the inſtruments, gate, or door to a higher glory; yet unto the others, an entrance unto final judgments. Therefore Saints think it neither no loſs when tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations ſeize upon them, they become more weighty, more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, more ſound, more ſincere, more experimental, more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and at laſt more glorious thereby: and on this ground, how little are they troubled when all the world is on fire, and in combuſtion about their ears; when many do call for the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall upon them, and hide them from the fiery indignation that is paſſing over, yet they are placide, ſerene, and in a Halci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition, all is peace with them, though all the world is fire about them, being ſo far above the world.</p>

So Chriſt tells the church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> with a <hi>Behold</hi> to uſher it in, <hi>I come quickly:</hi> what to do? But <hi>with that hour of temptation, upon all the world, to try all that dwell upon the earth:</hi> which hapned and fell out preſently after this Viſion was given unto <hi>John,</hi> in the time of <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, who ſucceeded <hi>Domitian,</hi> in whoſe days this Revelation was given to <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Patmos;</hi> and in the days of <hi>Trajan</hi> his ſucceſſor, this hour of temptation, tryal, affliction, and perſecution ſeized upon all the churches of Chriſt in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and elſe where. Therefore ſhe is exhorted to hold faſt what ſhe had received, and that is, the word of Chriſt, and his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53073:155"/>
patience, which ſhe had formerly received and kept, and that ſhe is now again exhorted to hold faſt, maintain, and perſevere in, when that hour of temptation cometh on all them that dwell upon the earth. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That the conſideration of Chriſt's ſpeedy coming with times of tryals upon his churches, is a ſpecial motive to perſevere with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the profeſſion of Chriſt and his truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we knew that judgement was ſo neer at the door, it would make us to trim up our lamps, to have them furniſhed with the oyl of faith, and light of good works, that we may be able to ſtand in the day of tryal. No greater motive to ſet an edge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our graces, then to know that Chriſt is near with times of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. If we knew the good man of the houſe would return this preſent day, we would have all things garniſhed to bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Hold faſt,</hi> for I come quickly; or elſe, as in the next words, you will loſe your honour, and your crown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hold that faſt which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</hi> As if Chriſt had ſaid to the church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Thou haſt hitherto kept the word of my patience, kept cloſe unto my Goſpel, go on couragiouſly in that courſe which thou haſt begun, hold faſt, and perſevere therein, leſt if thou fail in thy courſe, another come and take away thy crown and reward.</p>
                  <p>Here lies a difficulty, what is meant by this crown.</p>
                  <p>Some would have it eternal life, which is the crown of our faithful adhering to Chriſt and his doctrine; but I cannot adhere to this opinion: for this crown can never be taken away from the faithful; for though many that are only externally called, may be ſaid for non-perſevering, to loſe their crown which they once hoped for, and indeed, they never had true right and title to it, but only in their outward ſeeming call, and in the book of the viſible church, but not of God's election and predetermination, as formerly more at large is manifeſted verſe 5. on the book of life; Therefore ſurely this crown which may be taken away from the faithful, and given to another; for inconſtancy or non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in the truth, is that honour and reward which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in verſe 9. preceding: That all her enemies ſhould fall low before her, and worſhip before her feet: which kinde of crown and reward indeed may be taken away from the faithful for their looſeneſs, ſlothfulneſs, or remiſneſs in duties of godlineſs, to which they are often promiſed and annexed, and for want thereof, are often removed and given to a more profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and worthy people. So you ſee what is this crown that may be taken away from the faithful for their remiſneſs and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the truth, to wit, the honour and reverence which their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profeſſion acquired from the churches, and all perſons round about them. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:53073:155"/>Obſerv. <hi>That thoſe churches that hold faſt the truths of chriſt with most conſtancy and courage in the times of tryal, become the moſt honourable and worthy of a crown, of any people in the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who but <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was worthy that the obſtinate Jews, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unto the truth, ſhould come, and bow, and worſhip before her? She kept cloſe to the word of Chriſt's patience, therefore none ſhall take away her crown; her honour ſhall ſtill remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the churches, as long as any churches ſhall endure. If we tread in the ſteps of faithful <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and hold faſt, and go on manfully in the profeſſion of the faith, God will make the formal Jews of our times, the high pretending catholique church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to bow and worſhip before our feet. Is not our name, I mean the name of <hi>England,</hi> grown honourable among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their friends abroad, and terrible unto their enemies? And how comes this to paſs, but by means of the faithful in the land, that held faſt and maintained with courage and conſtancy the word of Chriſt's patience among us, in an hour of temptation and tryal, when the Prelatical fire of perſecutions were on foot? If we hold faſt to Chriſt, and perſiſt in his truth and doctrine, none ſhall be able to take away our crown; but if we flag in our duties to him, our crown will be the leſs, and our honour will ſoon flag alſo. When Iſrael kept cloſe to God, and reformed up unto his holy pattern in the Mount, God made them famous among the Nations, and a burdenſome ſtone to all that medled with them: but when they departed from God by their evil and abominable courſes, God gave them up into the hands of their enemies, and led them into the Land of captivity: and ſince for their obſtinacy in iniquity, they have quite loſt their crown, and become a diſperſed people, and a reproach among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons where they live. And this is according to that good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given by godly <hi>David,</hi> as his laſt Legacy to his wiſe ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. which is applicable to every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoul: <hi>And thou Solomon my ſon, Know thou the God of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde; for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the Imaginations of the thoughts, If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi>

                  <p>They are made pillars, and pillars in the church are honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are called pillars, great eminent Apoſtles, and thoſe were placed in the porch of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, for the great ornament and glory thereof: <hi>They ſit on Thrones, judging the Nations round about: They are made Kings and Prieſts unto their God:</hi> And what more honourable then thoſe high callings to the eye of men, of Kings, Prieſts, and Judges? Yea, the name of God, of Chriſt, and the new Jeruſalem is written upon them, and therefore ſure moſt honourable. Little do the high ones of this preſent generation, with their counterfeit and mock-honour, think that the now poor deſpicable Saints of Chriſt, whom they ſo much ſcorn and trample under-foot, are thoſe for whoſe ſakes the world is preſerved from flaming fires, and that one day ſhall become the only Kings, Rulers, and Princes thereof, maugre all the malice of Satan, and all their antichriſtian enemies in the world to the contrary. If the great and honourable perſons of the world did but verily believe that the Saints of Chriſt ſhould one day become ſo honourable in the preſence of the whole world, they would more eſteem them then they do, as Heirs, born unto ſo great a Kingdom. It is the common, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe practiſe of politique courtiers, when their old Soveraign or Prince is upon declining, they adore and worſhip the next Heir, or reputed Succeſſor, as the riſing Sun, as the neareſt ſtep to their preferments.

                  <p>Though ſome would have theſe words, <hi>to be made pillars in the Temple of God, and to go out no more,</hi> to ſignifie the ſtability of the faith of the elect, whereunto I cannot wholly aſſent; for though I grant, that the faithful (as <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) are made pillars for their ſtability in the faith and ſtrength of grace in the Temple of God, and their faith is ſo confirmed to them, that they never need to fear of utter failing or periſhing; yet there is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in this verſe, then a meer confirmation of the elect from non-falling away; for the next coherent words do connote ſo much: when Chriſt promiſes to write the name of the new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and the new name of Chriſt upon them, to be made pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the faith, and to be eſtabliſhed therein, was always a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued promiſe, and always performed to the church in all ages: but the name of the new Jeruſalem that comes down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the new name of Chriſt, which are annexed hereunto, were never yet made good unto the church, but hath reference unto a more glorious future church-ſtate on earth, ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>1. <hi>I ſaw a new heaven, and a new earth;</hi> which in verſ. 10. is called <hi>the great City, the holy Ieruſalem, deſcending out of heaven from God,</hi> which on the ſubſequent words of this verſe, ſhall more evidently be explained.

by Chriſt unto God, even the Father. But in the Fathers king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, both Chriſt and them ſhall reigne for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.5. And obſerve, that Chriſt's kingdom, and the Father's, are <hi>diverſa,</hi> but not <hi>contraria;</hi> or rather, that Chriſt's kingdom is but the morning prelude, prodromus, or firſt part of that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting one of God, even the Father: Chriſt's millenary king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was for Ruling, Judging, and Reigning over the obſtinate enemies of his, until all (by his rod of Iron) are brought ſubject to him, and deſtroyed, that oppoſed him; and ſo ſhall have an end when that work is done, and delivered up unto God, even the Father; whereupon begins that heavenly one of the Father's, wherein the Son himſelf ſhall be alſo ſubject unto him, that put all things under him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. ſo that thereby there will be no loſs to the Saints in the expiration of this of Chriſt's Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory and Judicial kingdom, when they are tranſlated into a more glorious and heavenly Kingdom, and City, whoſe Builder is God, and wherein there ſhall be no more curſe, but the Throne of God, and of the Lamb ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.3. The great work in this New Jeruſalem, is praiſe and Hallelujahs to the moſt high and beatifical Viſion, as it is in the fourth verſe; and they ſhall ſee his face, and his Name ſhall be in their foreheads, all tears, ſorrow, and the curſe ſhall be quite wiped off in this new heaven-like ſtate of the Father's Kingdom, which were not from all perſons in the former of the Son's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py millenary Kingdom; for though Satan was bound therein, that none was found to hurt in all that holy mountain, or that happy Kingdom, yet ſtill ſubject under it there remains the Nations of the four quarters of the world, during the whole term of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Imperial reigne; or elſe, whom had the Saints to reigne over and govern during that time? And otherwiſe, How poſſibly could they convene as the ſands of the Sea-ſhore, to make war againſt the holy city under <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> cap. 20. 8. by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of Satan let looſe among them? And if thoſe Nations ſhall ſtill remain (as evident they ſhall) during the Saints domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Empire, doubtleſs though Satan and they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from oppoſing the peace and quiet of the Saints in their Reign and Kingdom, yet they ſhall not be ſo reſtrained, as to be void of corruptions, ſins, and impieties among themſelves, which therefore are not void of the curſe, as reſpecting themſelves, nor conſequently of tears and ſorrow, and death, the moſt due wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin.

deſigns againſt their Lords and Rulers, the holy Saints of Chriſt, towards the latter end of their Reigne, and in caſting off their bonds, if poſſibly they could. In ſhort, I conceive, Satan and they, during the Saints Imperial Reigne, to be bound up from open oppoſing, hurting, or violating the peace, comfort, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Saints; but not ſo, as Satan ſhould not tempt the Nations ſubject unto the Saints, that they thereby ſhould be free from ſin, which will be alone the priviledge and prerogative only of the reigning Saints; and therefore I am of opinion, that the Saints thouſand years Empire, is but the beginning and firſt fruits of their happy new church-ſtate and heavenly city, that comes down from God; and is tranſitory, and ſhall paſs away, after all things are made ſubject unto Chriſt: But another more glorious ſhall immediately ſucceed in the room thereof, which is from God even the Father, and is everlaſting; and this city had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. and to conclude this, I am of the minde notwithſtanding; That Chriſt's Kingdom and the Father's, do only differ in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and in the equality of glory, but not in glory it ſelf: both are ſinleſs, both ſorrowleſs, both deathleſs, both glorious: but herein they differ, That that of the Sons is a Kingdom of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and judgement, which ſhall have an end; and therefore leſs glorious then that of the Father's, though in it ſelf moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but that of God the Father's, is a Kingdom of praiſes and Hallelujahs to the moſt High, endleſs and everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Grant O God, that thy poor ſervant may be kept faithful unto thee, and become a true Philadelphian, overcoming his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this life, that he may be made at laſt a pillar in thy New Temple, a partaker in the great hopes of the Saints in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Son, and of God, even the Father, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>There is a threefold name to be written on the conquering Saints of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> of God, of the new Jeruſalem, and the new Name of the Son. This name ſhall be ſet upon the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Saints, to denote whoſe they are; as the followers of the Beaſt and Antichriſt have the mark of Antichriſt and the Beaſt upon them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. that they may be known and manifeſt, ſo God's peculiar choſen ones have alſo his mark upon them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare forth unto others whoſe they are. And this name herein promiſed, is not the ordinary name of God that the Saints bear this preſent time, of holy, godly, or the like; for this is to be written on in the future, that all may ſee it without heſitating or doubting that they are God's, in that time when that new Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem comes down from heaven. The Saints had always, and at

all times the name of God and Chriſt upon them, being called godly chriſtians, &amp;c. But here is a new name of Chriſt and God to be written on them, which formerly they were unacquainted with: and what is that name of God but <hi>El-Shaddai,</hi> God of power and ſtrength, that ſhall be ſet upon them?

All other Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies were but partial in reſpect of this: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s and the Perſians reached but part of <hi>Aſia. Alexander</hi>'s but a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then theirs. The Roman <hi>Caeſars,</hi> though farther in the Weſt then the former, yet not ſo extenſive in the Eaſt as theirs. The <hi>Spaniſh, Mahometan. Turkiſh, Perſian, Tartarian,</hi> and the reſt of the Monarchies that are now a foot in the world, the ſeveral branches, heads, or horns of the latter, former, Roman Beaſt, are but ſmall in reſpect of this univerſal Monarchy the church ſhall enjoy before the end of the world here on earth: This mountain ſhall be ſet on the top of all other mountains: Chriſt and his Saints ſhall be the univerſal Monarchy in the world: He and they ſhall rule the Nations, not one of them, but all of them, with a rod of iron; which never as yet was fulfilled, but rather the contrary, and therefore to be expected in its due time and ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But the great queſtion and doubt is, whether this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant ſtate of the church ſhall be here on earth, or in the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heavens, as ſome would have it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, The new Ieruſalem, or new church-ſtate, is to come down from God out of heaven, as aforeſaid, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſure not in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteouſneſs, according to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. now righteouſneſs or juſtice is properly in earth among living Saints, and is given unto them as an additional promiſe of future happineſs: in heaven above there was no fear to miſs it, or needed any promiſe for the confirmation of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In this new State Chriſt ſhall rule the Nations with a rod of iron; now ſurely 'tis well known there are no Nations in heaven to be ruled with a rod of iron, and therefore it muſt be on earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This new city was meaſured by the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.17. and it was found according to the meaſure of man, that is of the Angel, one hundred forty and four cubits: and how this finite meaſure can ſuit with the infiniteneſs and immeaſurableneſs of the ſupernal heavens, let the wiſe conſider: therefore ſurely it muſt be meant of an eſtate on earth.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In verſe 24. it is ſaid, <hi>That the Kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour unto it;</hi> now this cannot be ſaid of the ſupernal heavens, for they can bring no addition unto that.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To this new ſtate there is promiſed; <hi>That God will wipe off all ſorrow and tears, and that there ſhall be no night there.</hi> Now this were ſuperfluous to be promiſed and added to the ſupernal heaven, the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53073:160"/>
habitation of Gods glory, and therefore it muſt be fulfilled to a new church ſtate here on earth.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and laſtly, How unreaſonable would it be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the inviſible heavens above, with rivers, with ſtreets, and with trees therein, ſutable only to an eſtate here on earth, as this is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1, 2. And this is that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. which is the mother of us all; it is called heavenly, and from above, becauſe of its divine original, and of its right of inheritance; and it is ſaid to deſcend, or come down from God, becauſe God's ſingular power and mercy ſhall gloriouſly appear in building this new city: And this new heaven or heavenly church ſtate, ſhall be on earth, according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.1. and underſtand that <hi>ſubordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But another queſtion may be made, whether this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial reigne of the Saints, ſhall be after the general reſurrection and judgment, or before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, after the particular reſurrection of the Saints, and before the ultimate end of the judgment of the Nations and wicked of the world, the Saints ſhall firſt ariſe and come with Chriſt, and meet him in the clouds, and be joyned to the Saints that are then alive, which at the ſounding of Chriſt's trump, and in a moment, ſhall be changed, and made immortal, as their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the raiſed ones are, and they ſhall reigne a thouſand years, and over whom? but over the unbelieving Nations of the world. And this is Chriſt's great day of judgment, and the day of his reigne, wherein himſelf with his Saints and members do reign over, and judge the wicked of the world, wherein a thouſand years is but as one day with God; and this he does before the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate act of all, for towards the evening of this great day, God ſuffers Satan to gather together all the wicked of the world, as the ſand of the Sea ſhore, under the conduct of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to endeavour the ruine of theſe immortal Saints, if it were poſſible, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.8, 9. but they are all taken in that enterprize, with their leader Satan, and caſt into the lake of everlaſting fire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thereon follows the general reſurrection and judgement of all, and all that were not found written in the book of life, were caſt into that lake of fire, which is the ſecond death. And I would willingly demand of all that are contrary minded, to what end ſhould this new Jeruſalem come down from heaven after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral judgement, or after the ultimate end of all, when all the elect Saints of God ſhall be tranſlated into heaven, into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, even the Father? They that ſhould conceive that
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53073:161"/>
the new Jeruſalem, or church ſtate ſhould deſcend unto the earth after all the Saints are carryed by Chriſt unto his long before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared manſion, even into that heavenly place where himſelf ſhall be, and ſo we alſo ſhall be for ever with the Lord, 1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 4.17. <hi>John</hi> 17.24. I ſhould judge them to want ſome Hellebore, or rather, true light from above, to enlighten their dark underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this particular: and therefore ſure the time of the Saints triumphant reigne, is to be here on earth, before the ultimate end, and general judgement of all the world.</p>
                  <p>From the words, <hi>Which ſhall come down from heaven from my God,</hi> Obſerve,</p>

                  <p>Now the great queſtion is, Who are the true church, or the only Saints in the world?</p>
                  <p>This queſtion then will be cleared, and put out of doubt, and not till then wholly, but in part, according to the ſeveral mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of outward tokens and characters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit and hypocritical; but then there ſhall be no deceit, no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie ſhall lye hid; the name of God will be writ upon them, and of the new Jeruſalem, and of the Son of God, and it will be ſo eminently obvious to all beholders, and ſo plainly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the operations and effects thereof, as if the very name had been written in their foreheads: and ſurely it muſt needs be ſo, for this new city comes down from God, he being the builder of it, and <hi>John</hi> ſaw (by a prophetical Viſion) this new City coming down from God out of heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2. And if it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come down from God, as ſome of thoſe days do vainly dream of, it would ſurely be known and acknowledged both by the godly and ungodly alſo: by the godly, as being the eſpecial workmanſhip of his own hand only, in which their ſouls would delight: Neither can they be ignorant thereof, being to be ſharers and compartners in that Kingdom, though differing from one another in judgements and opinions: the weak chriſtian ſhall be a partner therein as well as the ſtrong, and therefore all of this ſort muſt needs know it, if it were come down from heaven on earth already.</p>

                  <p>The ſeventh and laſt of Chriſt's monitory Epiſtles, is written to the chief Miniſter or Paſtor of the church of the Laodiceans, which was <hi>Archippus,</hi> as ſome ſay, mentioned <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 4.17. not far from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in the leſſer <hi>Aſia.</hi> It was called <hi>Laodicea,</hi> from <hi>Laodice,</hi> wife of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who built it in honour of his wife, and called it according to her name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Laodicea;</hi> which name in the Greek ſignifies as much as Commandreſs, Princeſs, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatrix of the people.</p>
                  <p>The nature and diſpoſition of this church was ſomwhat agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the nature of her name: She conceived her ſelf to be a glorious church, a Princeſs amongſt the reſt of her Siſter church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for ſo in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. ſhe vaunts her ſelf to be rich, to be increaſed with goods, and to want nothing: But when the Spirit of Chriſt brought her to the tryal, ſhe was found wretched, miſerable, poor, blinde, and naked. Hence by the way Note,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt was called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he was the Saviour of the world: <hi>Ioſhua</hi> had a name alſo from the ſame root, he being alſo a temporal Saviour unto Iſrael, leading them into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaving and delivering them from the hands and fury of the Canaanites, the ancient inhabitants of the holy Land. Many examples are found of the like kinde, as <hi>Iohn,</hi> whoſe name and nature both were gracious: <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> he was an eloquent gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den mouthed Father, and he had a name ſutable to his nature.

the general deſcription of Chriſt in the preliminary Epiſtle to the ſeven churches in the firſt chapter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he is called the <hi>Amen,</hi> out of the eighteenth verſe of the firſt chapter, to denote unto us,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And that the truth hereof may not fail, he adds another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty taken out of chap. 1. v. 5. <hi>He being the faithful and true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Now what this <hi>Amen</hi> hath promiſed, predicted, and ſaid in theſe propheſies muſt needs be ſure and firm; for, <hi>In him,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>are all the promiſes of God, yea and Amen:</hi> and that he may get the better faith and credence thereunto, he adds another title, <hi>The faithful and true witneſs. Paul</hi> could publiquely profeſs, That he was a faithful witneſs of the mind and counſel of God to his diſcſples, and that he had hid nothing back that did neceſſarily conduce to their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and think ye that Chriſt in theſe Revelations hath not dealt as the faithful and true witneſs, who is the God of all truth himſelf? O ye of little faith, that will not believe the truth of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, the downfal of the Beaſt, Babylon, and the whore, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſurrection of the witneſſes, and the churches glorious reſtored ſtate on earth before the end of the world, which are clearly and fully aſſerted and evidenced from this book of Propheſies? Hath not Chriſt promiſed it that is the <hi>Amen?</hi> in whom all the promiſes are yea and Amen, and coming from him that is the true and faithful witneſs, that can never fail? And to take off all ſuſpition of failure of the truth of thoſe propheſies, there is a third property here added, <hi>The beginning of the Creation of God.</hi> This hath relation to that deſcription of Chriſt in chap. 1. v. 8. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. It may be rendred either, <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Creation of God,</hi> or, <hi>The principality of the Creation of God.</hi> For Chriſt is both the beginning of all creatures; for, <hi>by him all things were made, and without him nothing were made:</hi> and he is alſo the ſupreme Prince and Governour of all the works of the creation; for ſo it neceſſarily follows, That all things ſhould be ſubject to his principality and government, who did at firſt create them, and give a Being to them. Therefore to ſhut up this, The ſayings of theſe Propheſies in this book muſt needs be ſure and come to paſs in their appointed ſeaſons, ſeeing the <hi>Amen,</hi> the <hi>faithful and true witneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Creator, Preſerver, and Governour of all the works of the Creation</hi> hath ſaid and ſpoken them; who will not then believe them, coming firſt from ſo faithful and true a witneſs, and from one who is the beginning and Prince of the whole creation, and therefore moſt able to perform them?</p>

                     <hi>I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot.] Laodicea</hi> was of a ſtrange mongrel compoſure and temper, <hi>neither cold nor hot,</hi> moulded and compacted as a certain odd extraction of two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, cold and heat: I thought before this, that that maxime was in all things unqueſtionable, <hi>In medio conſistit virtus:</hi> It ſeems
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53073:163"/>
true Religion will not admit of that Principle; for <hi>Laodicea</hi> is here blamed to be in the mean; that is, in a frame or temper which is neither hot nor cold. By <hi>hot</hi> is here underſtood one that is zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, fervent in ſpirit; for the truth and worſhip of God, that cannot endure any corruptions, will-worſhips or ſuperſtitions ſhall be admitted in the true chriſtian Worſhip and Religion; and ſuch a one is called a hot fervent or zealous chriſtian; and this can never be too intenſe as unto the degrees thereof, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, and according to ſound knowledg. The ignorant incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate zeal is reproued and condemned as dangerous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious, not the ſound and orthodox: It is not with God's gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as with moral habits of vertues, wherein both the extreams ſtraying from mediocrity, either in the exceſs or in the defect, are faults and vices; as the exceſs of liberality may run into prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the defect into covetous parſimony; or the exceſs in fortitude may be called temerity and fool-hardineſs, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cowardiſe and puſilanimity, and ſo in the reſt: but in graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits the caſe is different, Souls cannot exceed therein, <hi>Be ye holy as your heavenly Father is holy;</hi> no leſs then an aim unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection will ſerve turn; be zealous, fervent, boyling hot for God and his truth, it being ſound and conſiderate, it will admit of no mediocrity: Lukewarmneſs, or half friend to God and his ways, is equally an abomination in God's ſight (for he requires the whole heart) as is coldneſs or deadneſs it ſelf; and therefore this ſtrange commixture of tempers in <hi>Laodicea</hi> is exploded by Chriſt as moſt dangerous and pernitious, and therefore adds, <hi>I would thou wert cold or hot.</hi> Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>A lukewarm temper among Christians is not only diſapro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by Christ, but alſo dangerous and pernitious to their Souls welfare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt could not give one good word of <hi>Laodicea</hi> for this very reaſon; but in the next verſe was ready to ſpew her out, for this her remiſſneſs and mediocrity. Some will neither be faſt friends to Religion, nor yet utterly oppoſite unto it, a true hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditical Laodicean temper: But what makes them thus to hancker and halt betwen two extreames, that they are neither hot nor cold? In their very foreheads you may read the reaſon, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreſt, worldly profit, worldly honours do ſo over-bias them that they will be partly religious, and ſo far forth friends unto it, as may get them repute, and ſo be accounted prudent, civil, and honeſt men; but for the better part of it, to have the heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for God, and the affections kindled and intenſe upon and for the glory of God in the day of tryals and perſecutions, they will not touch upon that, they did not take Chriſt upon ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to follow him to his croſs, there they will leave him; as long as he provides loaves for them they will follow him, but when he is dragged to the Judgment Hall, as our true ſummer-bird
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53073:164"/>
at the approach of winter, they fly into their holes for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and will not appear more for Chriſt, until he returns with a ſun ſhine and ſpring of proſperity upon them. Theſe are our moderate politique ſtate chriſtians, who are neither hot nor cold, true Hermophrodites in Religion, that will not move a foot far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matters thereof then what the State dictates to them: If the Prince, as in the days of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> command Popery, Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall up for them; if a Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſucceed, all preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and become Proteſtants; if ſhe will have Prelacy in the church maintained, there will be found aſſertors enough of its <hi>jure divino;</hi> if Presbitery ſhall take the Throne, all of our State chriſtians will preſently fall in to the Geneva and Scottiſh garb; if Independency ſhall get at top, preſently our Laodiceans run to New-<hi>England</hi> for a model; if that again come out of faſhion, they are ready to run to <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for a new pattern: So indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent are ſuch Laodicean chriſtians in matters of Religion, that whatſoever form or intreſt of all ſorts ſhall be uppermoſt, they will be ſure to be of that ſide; and this proceeds from their luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm temper and defect, or want of heat or true zeal in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they profeſs; if they were zealous in any form, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, yet they would more cloſely ſtick unto it: <hi>Paul,</hi> whiles he was a perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> was zealous though in a bad caſe: So the Jews had a zeal unto God, though not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: <hi>Rom,</hi> 10.1. The Papiſts to this day continue zealous to their Superſtitions and will Worſhip: Only thoſe that pretend higheſt and to be raiſed out of the graves of Antichriſt, and to come to a higher pitch of Reformation then any other chriſtian Profeſſors in the world, are like true Laodiceans, neither hot nor cold. I believe that Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> though not Prophetically, yet prudentially enough, likned and applied the ſtate of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh church, as a true counterpane of its pattern, to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in the times when he wrote; for we may obſerve ſtill the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temper in her children at preſent, as he obſerved in their fore-fathers in his time; they are of that mediocrity, that they care not what Religion they follow, ſo their intreſts, honors, and eſtates are ſecured and maintained; I confeſs they are willing to admit of part of the truths of Chriſt in Doctrines; but for the miniſtration of Diſcipline, Governments, and Miniſterial Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they are very well ſtill contented to retain them that come from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> and not from Chriſt and his holy church; therefore they are to look to it leaſt they are ſpewed out as their fore-fathers the Prelates, for their Laodicean temper and half Reformation, which hitherto they have but as yet attained to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But here it may be ſaid, May not chriſtians be too hot, too zealous in their intentions towards things of their Religion? were not a moderater carriage and temperature more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53073:164"/>
in them, and more advantageous to the work of the Goſpel then an over fiery zealous one?</p>
                  <p>To anſwer this Queſtion, firſt underſtand, whereof zeal is compounded, and that is, firſt of an intention of the affections, or an enlarged love on the thing beloved. Secondly, Of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which is with great indignation and grief, when an injury (true or ſuppoſed) is offered to the thing ſo fervently loved: So this affection of zeal is not ſimply good or evil but is an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent paſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> found in men both good and evil; for the Apoſtles were zealous, and ſo were the Phariſees, Chriſtians were zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo were the Jews; ſo ſome of the reformed are zealous in their ways, ſo many alſo of the Papiſts; but that that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates zeal either good or evil, is firſt in reſpect of its object; godly zeal muſt have the knowledg of a right object; it muſt be truly God's glory, God's worſhip, God's truth, God's will and doctrine either in part or in the whole, and that indubitably, that denominates a godly zeal: A zeal to God out of Chriſt, as the Iews had, will not ſuffice to call it a truly godly zeal, becauſe it was not according to knowledg, nor having an adequate and compleat object; 'tis true, their zeal towards God was good and commendable in them, but becauſe it was not guided by ſound knowledg, it was blind and erroneous; and therefore vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious for want of a compleat object.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It grieveth for the wrong truly done and not ſuppoſed, as the Iews thought was done by the preaching of the Goſpel unto the glory of God and his true worſhip. True godly zeal muſt have right ends, it ever affecteth and ſeeketh the honour of God, and not ſelf praiſe and vain glory. Examples of this true godly zeal we have in Chriſt, when he whipped the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. and in <hi>Phineas, Numb.</hi> 25.8, 11. in <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> when they rent their cloathes, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.19. and <hi>Moſes</hi> when he broke the Tables, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. and in <hi>Paul</hi> for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. and for the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 4.19. But many for want of right objects, right ends, and other due ingredients, have miſſed of true zeal, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> his zeal for <hi>Diana, Act.</hi> 19. whom he ought not to have loved; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> a Phariſee was zealous, but he loved that that he ſhould not have loved, that is, his own righteouſneſs by the Law, as the reſt of the Phariſaical Iews did. <hi>Jehu</hi> was zealous but failed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.6. The Apoſtles out of zeal wiſhing fire upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Samaria, Luk.</hi> 9.54. failed in the end of their zeal, it being not out of pure affection to God's glory, or out of charity unto their neighbours, but out of revenge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, as from Bonarges, Sons of Thunder; and how zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hot are the Papiſts this day for their ſcarlet Strumpet and her fornications, which ought not to be loved, and therefore no true zeal, but ſpurious and impious. The reaſon of all this is
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53073:165"/>
that a mans intentions are never good, be they never ſo highly pretending thereunto; but when they are built upon a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to wit, the Word of God, and referred to right ends, namely, the praiſe of God, and the good of his church and people.</p>
                  <p>Now to return to anſwer the doubt propoſed, having cleared what true zeal is; with the circumſtances thereof, I anſwer, That we cannot be too zealous when a right object and right ends are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. exhorteth men to be <hi>fervent in the Spirit,</hi> hot, boyling hot in ſpiritual affairs: What think ye of <hi>Paul</hi> when he oppoſed <hi>Peter</hi> to his face in the buſineſs of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and would not give way to his diſſimulation, no not for an hour? ſo zealous was he for the truth of God. God is ſo zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his own honour and glory, that he ſmote <hi>Uzzah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6, 7. for putting only his hand unto the Ark, out of an ignorant zeal to ſave it from falling unto the ground; one would have thought, that God would have commended his zeal, and ſpared his ignorance herein, but being not according unto knowledge, but contrary to the command of God, he ſuffered for it. No good intentions and meanings will make that action or duty good or lawful, be it ever ſo ſpeciouſly religious and gracious, that is not warranted by the rule of the Scriptures: the beſt duties for want of this ſcantling, are turned into ſin. And as God is zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of his glory, ſo he makes his Miniſters like himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. <hi>He makes his Miniſters a flame of fire.</hi> I would have all indifferent lukewarm moderate State-chriſtians to conſider with themſelves, whether could the Apoſtles and firſt Diſciples of Chriſt, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily propagate the Goſpel thorow the world, if they had been all of an indifferent lukewarm Laodicean temper? Chriſt himſelf was thought by the people to be one too hot, that his zeal was beyond his judgement, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.21. and therefore ſaid, <hi>He was beſide himſelf: Paul</hi> was alſo accounted mad, not only by <hi>Feſtus,</hi> for his zeal towards God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.24. but alſo by the chriſtian <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>13. So <hi>Michel</hi> ſcoft at <hi>David</hi> as one of the fools for his zeal; yet though they, and other Saints of God were vilified and reproached by the ignorant world, yet their zeal have laid that corner ſtone, and foundation of ſalvation, that all the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. What think you, will the ſcarlet whore that ſitteth as a Queen be dethroned, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt be diſcovered and overthrown by a moderate lukewarm Laodicean State, Religion, and Temper? Surely the firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners and Founders of our Reformation, were of another ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit then we in theſe days are of, or elſe it would have made but a ſlow procedure: for want of this true zeal, our Reformation is at a ſtand, and in ſpiritual growth, <hi>non progredi, eſt regredi.</hi> But I would ſtill be underſtood, that it muſt be a zeal mixed with the former ingredients, and with ſound knowledge, that it may be as an eye, and a guide, to direct and conduct it aright, both in the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53073:165"/>
things to be loved, and in the manner and ends of their love, or elſe, zeal not rightly regulated, may be dangerous and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. There are three ſorts of people that offend and fail in their zeal.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe that are ſtark cold, and have no zeal at all to Gods glory, or his worſhip, as the profane worldling is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thoſe indifferent lukewarm chriſtians, that are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hot nor cold, as thoſe Laodiceans were, and as the Iſraelites of old, halting between God and Baal, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21.</p>
                  <p>The third ſort are, They whoſe zeal is blind, void of ſound knowledge and godly wiſdom, who covering their own carnal affections with the cloak of glorifying of God, ruſh on inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately into many evil and unlawful actions: Some on this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, endeavour again in theſe our days, to ſet up Antichriſt in his Throne among us: Others, on the other hand, for want of this ſound knowledge joyned to their zeal, under pretence of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down Antichriſt and the Scarlet whore, they endeavour to undermine and pull down all Magiſtracy, Miniſtery, Scriptures, and all the Ordinances in Chriſt's churches whatſoever, whereof this age of ours affords as many lamentable examples as any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whatſoever; therefore let every one be inſtant with God in prayer, to add wiſdom and ſound knowledge unto his zeal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, That in controverted opinions of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that lye deep and dark, whether they are the will of God or not, moderation in ſuch things is moſt commendable, and let every one walk as he hath attained unto; for I am of opinion, that all controverted points and myſteries in the Word of God, will not be made manifeſt unto us, until the day of the revelation of all things, when Chriſt the great Key-bearer of the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhall appear, to open all the ſealed books, and no man ſhall ſhut again; and ſo that Scripture in ſuch things may be rightly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Be not righteous over much:</hi> that is, be not over zealous, hot, or fervent for them. But for plain, obvious, and perſpicuous commands and truths of God, as whether Chriſt's precepts and commands, or Antichriſt's, are to be followed and embraced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our zeal and intentions here cannot be too hot, we cannot poſſibly here admit of a Syncratiſm, or a mean, as worldly wiſe <hi>Caſsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> would endeavour between Papiſt and Proteſtant; either God muſt be God, or <hi>Baal</hi> muſt be God: either Chriſt muſt have the Throne, or elſe Antichriſt muſt reigne; they cannot poſſibly inhabite in one Temple, God and Dagon will not correſpond; no degree of zeal herein will ſuffice, but what is the higheſt, and aimeth at perfection: the defect whereof, either that of coldneſs, which is more remote, or that of lukewarmneſs, which is nearer, is equally faulty in this particular; either let us be altogether Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, or altogether Reformed; either fully zealous for Chriſt and his ways, or elſe cold thereunto; for no mean will ſerve turn,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53073:166"/>
Therefore Chriſt in the next words ſays to lukewarm <hi>Laodicea, I would thou wert cold or hot.</hi> That is, I would thou wert reſolved one way or other, I rather thou wert any thing then what thou art; I would as rather thou wert of no Religion, as of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel uncertain hotchpotch Religion that thou art of. From theſe words Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That a luke-warm Religion is equally, if not more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto God, then irreligion, or profaneſs itſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt here prefers coldneſs, the moſt remote degree in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, before a nearer luke-warmneſs: Chriſt wiſhed <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be hot, zealous in the things of God, or elſe cold, that is, dead, ſtrange, and alienated to the things of God, rather then indifferent and lukewarm, as ſhe was. It is as good, and there were as much hopes of us, if we were altogether Romiſh, then half Reformed as we are.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons that this luke-warm temper is more blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and dangerous then coldneſs it ſelf, are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe where there are moſt means of grace, there ſhould be greateſt improvement; Sin is more ſinful, where grace is more abounding, <hi>the ſervant that knows his maſters will and doth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not, is worthy of many ſtripes;</hi> the ſin of our firſt parents was the more aggravating, being committed in paradice; the fall of the Angels in heaven left them remedileſs and unpardonable: and that idolatry of thoſe twenty five men in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16. between the Porch and the Altar, was moſt deteſtable: God would rather that his grace ſhould not be known, then that it ſhould be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed; he will be ſanctified of all that come near unto him; Therefore <hi>if Baal be God, follow him: why halt ye between both!</hi> God hateth ſuch ſcrupulous inquiſition, as if it were hard to determine which part to follow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe there are greater hopes of the converſion of the irreligious profane of the world, if God ſhall be pleaſed to afford them the means, then of the luke-warm chriſtians, who think all is well with them becauſe of their moderation and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, which indeed is honoured of the world, and for ſome other external priviledges that they enjoy: O! How hard a thing it is this day, to perſwade the moderate indifferent State-chriſtians into the true power of godlineſs, or unto a fervent zeal for God and his Truths, they think they have enough in their birth-right, church priviledges, or common profeſſion, to make them everlaſtingly happy, and therefore think they, what need they trouble themſelves more, they never intended to take heaven by violence, if it would deſcend unto them in a bed of Doune, in an eaſie way, then they would be in for it; but if otherwiſe it be to be taken by ſtriving and violence, then let the violent take it for them, they will have nothing more to do with it: Therefore ſurely Publicans and Harlots ſhall ſooner enter into the Kingdom
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53073:166"/>
of heaven, then ſuch eaſie luke-warm Profeſſors, who are neither hot nor cold, I would they were hot or cold.</p>

If it be demanded who is to be ſpewed out? The anſwer is ready, Thou lukewarm Angel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and thou lukewarm church of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> for though the charge be directed to the particular Angels of each church; yet the churches too being guilty of the ſame ſins, are under the ſame judgements and threats which are inſcribed unto their Angels or Paſtors; and therefore there is ſtill added as an Epiphonema to each Epiſtle, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the matter of their ſin, it is luke-warmneſs, an indifferent diſpoſition and temper in Religion, which is neither hot nor cold, which was opened in the laſt precedent verſe, and the danger thereof demonſtrated accordingly: but in this (by the way) I would be underſtood, not that Chriſt ſimply alloweth coldneſs in Religion, but only preferreth it before luke-warmneſs, for the reaſons before on the laſt verſe expreſſed; and we daylie ſee, that God ſpareth longer notoriouſly wicked perſons, or thoſe that are ſtrangers from him altogether, rather then the luke-warm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors: and this appears from God's long forbearance of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath played egregiouſly the harlot, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the truth, and yet flouriſheth outwardly, whiles the Reformed churches are corrected and chaſtiſed out of hand, when they incline unto luke-warmneſs and indifferency in Religion. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>God's judgements on luke-warm Chriſtians are dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judicious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="290" facs="tcp:53073:167"/>This appeareth, if we conſider but what Chriſt meaneth, when he ſaith, <hi>He will ſpew him out of his mouth;</hi> by which is meant, an utter caſting out of this luke-warm church from her church-ſtate and profeſſion, he will no longer entertain her as his candleſtick, but will diſcharge his care of her in that particular, as a ſtomack-ſick perſon with eating or drinking that which he loatheth, deſireth vomit to eaſe him of his ſickneſs; ſo Chriſt deſireth to diſcharge his ſtomack, his care, his vigilance of this loathed luke-warm church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As meat once vomited up lies loathed and abhorred, and never to be licked up again but by Dogs or Sows; ſo this luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm church is to be ſpewed out as a loathed thing, not that Chriſt would ever return to ſo unclean a thing again.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As in vomiting, an unclean place is ſought for, ſo Chriſt will ſeek for an unclean place, to ſpew out thoſe luke-warm Profeſſors into: <hi>He will make the place of their habitation a Cage of all unclean birds, Ziim and Oiim ſhall dwell there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hath not Chriſt begun this work of ſpewing out of his mouth the luke-warm Prelatical church within our days? How long did it lye as a loathed and indigeſted lump in the ſtomack of Chriſt before it came to egeſtion? This was Chriſt's goodneſs, long expecting repentance and thorow reformation from our churches, who began in the days of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> to be warm in Religion, and never came to a farther degree then luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or a moderate civil State-religion; and therefore Chriſt's ſtomack being long troubled with this undigeſted bit, up it muſt come at laſt. So it was in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate, Stiria, Alſatia, Austria,</hi> and other Provinces there, whiles God expected they ſhould reform up to the pattern in the Mount, they only ſtick'd to <hi>Luthers</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> firſt principles, and moved no farther, and withal, abated ſo much of their firſt heat, that they became luke-warm and indifferent to things of Religion, as if Popery and Reformation were things indifferent; and ſo clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed their reformed doctrines and worſhip with many of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots raggs, rites, and trumperies; for which tepid and mongrel diſpoſition of theirs, they were ſeverely chaſtiſed by Chriſt, and ſome of the churches quite ſpewed out of his mouth for this their ſin: hath not God done the very ſame thing with us here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> here of late for this hermaphrodical religion that was profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt us, half popiſh, half reformed, half rotten, half ſound, even ſpewed it out root and branch, never to be licked up more? Is it not alſo to be feared, that the ſame mongrel luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm condition is creeping in upon us again? What meaneth elſe the many vindications that are ſet forth of late, of the lawfulneſs of their practiſes, doctrines, miſſions, calls, hyerarchical ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendencies, national churches, and maintenancies, and the like? If Chriſt have vomited them out as unholy things, he will not
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53073:167"/>
return again to take them up, they are loathed of him for their mongrel temper, and therefore ſpewed out; and if you will know who they are that endeavours to lick them up again, They are dogs, I mean, whelps of <hi>Rome,</hi> that deſire to return to their vomit; They are Sows, I mean, unclean worldlings, that make their belly their God, that deſire to return to wallow in the myre of Antichriſtian fooleries. I ſhall ſay no more but this, If Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation according to Goſpel pattern be the way, be zealous in it, burn in it, walk in it, ſtoutly, couragiouſly, as children of light: but if <hi>Rome</hi> be the way to the new Jeruſalem, take her mark, follow her, and be not aſhamed of her; for Chriſt will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a middle temperature between both, either be all Romiſh, or all Reformed; there is no medium between heaven and hell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther between true chriſtian and antichriſtian; either be the one or the other: for, becauſe thou art neither hot nor cold, it will come to paſs to thee, as it did to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Chriſt will ſpew thee out of his mouth. Be wiſe therefore ye children of light, <hi>Hold fast the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free;</hi> Have not your faces or thoughts towards the onyons and fleſh pots of <hi>Egypt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but let your faces be to <hi>Zion</hi>-wards, to build up the breaches thereof, and be hot, zealous, fervent therein, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to knowledge, and then doubtleſs, God will be with you, and lead you into <hi>Goſhen,</hi> into a land of peace and reſt.</p>

                     <hi>Laodiceas</hi> ſin of luke-warmneſs, had a two-fold ground or riſe. 1. Proceeding from a falſe perſwaſion of her own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs. 2. From the ignorance of her own miſery. Her vain perſwaſion of her own worth, proceeds from the conſideration and conceit of her great wealth and riches, not only ſpiritual, which ſhe wanted, and Chriſt adviſeth her to buy of him in the next verſe, but temporal and worldly; ſhe boaſts her ſelf not only to be rich, and abounding in riches of both ſorts, but alſo to want nothing, ſhe had ſuch a fulneſs, that her contentation was compleat: Many perſons may abound, and be rich, and yet want much of fulneſs of ſatisfaction and contentation: but the church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> it ſeemed, abounded to contentation, in her own conceit, which is the higheſt pitch of riches; for, <hi>ſhe had need of nothing:</hi> and hence grew that ſin of hers, luke-warmneſs, and half chriſtianity. From hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>That the moſt rich and abounding wealthy churches, are apteſt to become the more remiſs, moderate, indifferent, and luke-warm chriſtians.</hi>

The two firſt are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affections or accidents of her diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in reſpect of her ſelf, or of others, ſhe was in a pitiful, lamentable, and miſerable ſtate and condition: The three latter declare the very nature of her diſeaſe; <hi>ſhe was poor, blinde, and naked:</hi> you know to be poor, is to be beggarly, ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

in the Greek ſignifies, a beggar: She was not poor in ſpirit and in her own eyes, which is a bleſſed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. but ſhe was a poor beggarly miſerable one, one that is proud and beggarly, which is hateful, odious: She is a true beggar, beg ſhe will, and never leave begging of the Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Nobles, and Potentates of the world, till ſhe have gotten the choiſeſt fat things of the earth to become her patrimony. She is a ſtout ſturdy beggar; if you will not give, ſhe will take: Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars lye in the croſs lanes, and high-ways, to beg of all they meet; ſo beggars of this rampant church lye cloſe to all great Aſſemblies, to Dyets, Parliaments, Counſel-Tables, Great Mens houſes, to beg the Advowſons, and to catch the ſcraps of preferments that fall in their way: I could wiſh there were none of this beggarly poverty among us at this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt's true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould be of a nobler temper and Spirit then to ſerve at Tables for lucre ſake; their maſter will provide for them in a more honourable way, if they can but truſt on him for their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation and livelyhood. It was a wiſe obſervation of M. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s concerning our Engliſh clergie in his days under Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, That the Angel of <hi>England</hi> in plain terms grew wealthy by begging, and as he further ſays, neither is he in very truth, nor is to be called ought, ſave my Lord Beggar. In the next place, blindneſs is added to her beggarlineſs, to make it the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous: a blinde beggar is the moſt deplored and miſerable of all beggars, for being neceſſitated to ſeek and beg for his living abroad, yet want of ſight will not let him ſeek; ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of minde, want of true ſpiritual underſtanding, where true riches lies, is a great addition of miſery to a poor beggarly church that makes her to ſeek amiſs, and to call that riches which is not
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53073:169"/>
truly riches; from this ignorance and blindneſs it proceeds, that the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and others that follow her ſteps, do beg and ſeek greedily after riches, honours, and preferments, that are meerly tranſitory and vain, and leaves alone the true riches, the treaſure which is from above, that never periſheth: yea they are ſo blinde, and obſtinately blinde, that they are ready to ſtrike at him that endeavoureth to convince them of blindneſs, and to ſhew them the way unto everlaſting treaſure. In the laſt place there is added Nakedneſs, as an aggravation of the miſery of this church. When one is ſtript of his garments, and rendered naked, his ſhame is laid open to the view, according to that of <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.5. It is not ſufficient that ſhe is a poor blinde beggar, but ſhe is a naked blinde beggar, the moſt contemptible of all ſorts: We have ſeen the poverty, the blindneſs and ignorance of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Chriſt hath alſo diſcovered her nakedneſs unto us, we know her ſhames, and wherein her ſecret abominations does conſiſt: it is in vain for her now to boaſt of her ſpiritual pomps and trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whiles Chriſt hath diſcovered her skirts, and ſhown us that ſhe is a beggarly one, void of all true ſpiritual riches, that ſhe is a blinde one, ignorant of the ways of true happineſs, that ſhe is naked, that is, for want of ſpiritual garments about her, ſhe is left open and bare to all ſhame and reproaches that are caſt againſt her for her deformities, which are obvious to every ſpiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eye. O that God would make the Reformed churches amongſt us, to diſcern between true riches, and thoſe which are not ſo, but only in pretence; that he would put a nobler ſpirit into them then that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a beggarly poor one, waiting for the crums of preferments at the Tables of the Great ones of the world: Is not their Lord and Maſter the Lord and Soveraign of the whole creation, and ſhall he provide for the Ravens, and the Lions whelps, their meat in due ſeaſon, and will he forget the members of his own body? God forbid! Oh Chriſt, which art the true light of the Father, anoint our eyes with eye-ſalve, that our blindneſs may be done away, and diſcover our nakedneſs unto us, that we may ſeek unto thee for a covering, for gold that is tryed, and for a rayment, that we may be clothed, that our nakedneſs may not appear before thee, to our utter ſhame and confuſion, Amen.</p>

                  <p>But to open the words a little more fully: <hi>I counſel thee.</hi> It is Chriſt that counſels and adviſes, and who will not follow it? The matter of his counſel is offered to the church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and unto us alſo, if we be found in the ſame vain-glorious, yet beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly condition as ſhe was in; for the word was not written only to them, but to us; for obſerve what the Spirit often ſays; <hi>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the churches.</hi> So the matter of Chriſt's counſel is as well unto us, as unto <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> and that threefold, as the diſeaſe was threefold. 1. To buy gold, tryed gold, which is ſet againſt poverty. 2. White Garments, which is for a covering of her nakedneſs. 3. Eye-ſalve, which is a remedy for her blindneſs.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſends us not to our own works, or to his bleſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to any other Saint departed, with ſo many <hi>Ave Marias,</hi> ſo many <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> or ſo many Vows and Pilgrimages to buy them at their hands; but he tells us, <hi>Come buy them of me:</hi> Chriſt alone is the great diſpenſer of his Fathers Treaſure, all power is given into his hands, and in vain to ſeek the Kingdom of God or the treaſures thereof, but in, by, and through the Son; and it is moſt juſt it ſhould be ſo, it being the purchaſe of his death and paſſion; he powred out his ſoul unto death for us that he might have power to heal our ſouls of all their infirmities; therefore he is made unto us both wiſedom, juſtification, ſanctification, and all in all.</p>
                  <p>The manner of ſeeking this gold is by bargain and ſale, <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me:</hi> I ſhall inquire how this bargain is made up,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Underſtand in all legal contracts, there is an agreement of both parties, or elſe it cannot be a bargain.</p>

                  <p>Laſtly, There are other abſolute bargains and ſales of lands and goods, diſpoſed therein freely, only on the conſideration of the donors or granters of love, affection and preferment to the parties beloved, and ſo given freely to them and to their heirs for ever, without ſo much as paying a peny by way of legal retribution for it; yea the donor often is ſo free in his deed of gift, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee is freed of all fear of forfeiture of his Eſtate; for there is not reſerved ſo much as a Roſe or Pepper corn by way of Rent, that for non payment thereof, the State ſhould be become forfeited: And that party that would not be thankful to ſuch a free giver, is worſe then an Infidel.</p>
                  <p>Now to our heavenly bargain, and to apply: If we will buy of Chriſt gold and heavenly Treaſure, we muſt firſt come unto him, and ſtrike up the bargain with him; he will not ſell unto us againſt our wills (though he himſelf muſt make us firſt willing) and therefore he cries, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Come unto the waters, come ye buy and eat:</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. Chriſt is very willing to ſell us freely, and we muſt be ready to buy it and accept it freely; all that he expects at our hands, is to agree with him on his own tearms, and that is to accept it and receive it freely, beleive that he can and will do it, and it is done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He ties us up to no legal conſideration or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on our part, that on nonperformance thereof, be they ever ſo ſmall, we ſhould forfeit the State of our Inheritance; he hath paid and performed fully all our dues and legal conditions unto the Father for us, and in our ſtead; and he hath taken the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole Inheritance into his own hand; and therefore in the third place he is upon a free deed of gift with us, and if we will buy at his hands; we are to <hi>come and buy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wine and milk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, without price,</hi> Iſa. 55.1. and Chriſt calls in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. to him that is athirſt, <hi>Come, and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely;</hi> and they now that will not be obedient to the commands and laws of this gracious donor; by way of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and thankfulneſs for ſo glorious and free an Inheritance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon them, are not worthy of the leaſt mercy in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome if this Inheritance were entailed on us on condition of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or performance of a ſmall petty grain of corn or the like, as is the mite of our faith or obedience, &amp;c. as the Arminians would have it, we ſhould be in bondage fear and danger all our life long, if not at leaſt forfeit all by our non-payment and performance; therefore bleſſed be God, that hath not left our ſalvation in our own hands, but founded it on the rock Chriſt, which cannot be removed.</p>

                     <hi>I anſwer,</hi> He that goes about to buy a great Treaſure is very careful, diligent, and his affections intenſe upon it, that none put him out of his bargain: So it muſt be here for this heavenly Treaſure, we muſt be earneſt with Chriſt to ſtrike up this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we muſt not let him alone by our prayers until we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this pretious pearl at his hands: 'Tis true, Chriſt will ſell us this pear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hearts to ſeek after his refined gold, then ſurely we ſhall no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be ſo beggerly baſe, as to ſet up our own guilded parts in the room of Chriſt's true wiſedom, which is as gold thrice refined; neither ſhall we any longer ſet up our own church ways and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, according to our own prudential dictates, but ſhall come into the truly golden way of Chriſt, which is often tryed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the fire, and therefore avoideth not the touch-ſtone or fire of tryal, but ſtandeth firm as the pillars of the houſe of God, and they that truſt unto it and are partakers of it, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich, exceeding rich in all true ſpiritual graces, to their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory: Therefore for ſhame ye Miniſters and ſervants of Chriſt, that are truly ſuch, and conſcientious of your duties, leave of your beggerly trade, in purſuing that that is no riches, and come to Chriſt and buy gold of him tryed in the fire, that will make you rich to purpoſe, and ſo ſhall ye ſhine like Stars of the greater magnitude, within the Firmament of your churches; I feare me all is not gold that gliſters with you; O how dangerous it is to be in ſuch a ſeeming fair condition, when we conceit we are rich and lack nothing, whiles indeed we are poor, miſerable, blind and naked. The Angel of Laodicea once thought as well of himſelf, as the Angel of <hi>England</hi> at preſent; but ſee his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his hypocritical, outſide and half Religion, which is much to be feared by us alſo if we grow not hotter and repent; to wit, that it will ſhortly come to paſs, that Chriſt will ſpew us out of his mouth, and leave our place deſolate unto us; and this Chriſt doubtleſs would long ſince have done, if he had not a remnant amongſt us that are tryed gold, for whoſe ſake he doth preſerve us; yet underſtand, that Chriſt knows how to caſt off and burn up all the chaff, as he did the Prelatical party of late, in his judgments and fiery indignations, and to preſerve the wheat, the godly, ſafe and ſecure; he will preſerve them as gold in the Refiners fire, it ſhall ſuffer no diminution, whiles the droſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers loſs, and is quite burned up and conſumed by it; therefore in time be wiſe, repent and follow, hear Chriſt's counſel, buy gold of him tryed in the fire, that thou maiſt be rich.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſecond part of this heavenly purchaſe is <hi>white rayment</hi> that thou maiſt be cloathed: We formerly heard of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odiceas</hi> nakedneſs, of her ſhameful nakedneſs, now here is a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for her, a white garment that ſhe may be cloathed, and that the ſhame of her nakedneſs do not appear: We know nakedneſs in it ſelf was no ſhame before the fall, but ſince ſin hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is become vile and ſhameful, as God provided for <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, garments of skins to hide his ſhame; ſo Chriſt hath provided ſpiritually a white rayment, for the covering of all the ſpiritual defects and ſhame of the members of himſelf, the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Now this white rayment that is here provided and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt to <hi>Laodicea</hi> to cover her nakedneſs, may be taken
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53073:171"/>
two ways, as <hi>Laodicea</hi> had a twofold nakedneſs and ſhame upon her, ſo here is a garment proportionable to her wants. Firſt ſhe was naked in reſpect of true righteouſneſs, ſhe was rich enough and righteous enough in her own eyes, as many of theſe days are; yet here is a garment provided by Chriſt for her, to cover her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs: This is that garment ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.13, 14. which is the long white Robes that the undefiled followers of the Lamb do walk in, that have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Our ſins bring ſhame, and miſery, and nakedneſs upon us, and defilement on our ſouls, and it is Chriſt's blood that waſhes them white, takes off the ſtains, the guilt and obligation to wrath thereon, and ſerves for a white garment to cover, to hide and keep quite out of ſight all our bloody ſpots and ſtains, as if they were never done or committed, and ſo are carried away on the head of this ſcape-Goat, into the land of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs never to be remembred more. Secondly, She is naked too in reſpect of her outward garments, church officers, orders and ordinances; ſhe might be rich enough in outward endowments, as riches, worldly wiſedome, learning, &amp;c. as ſome of our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches amongſt us are, yet beggerly, poor and naked to the true calls, orders, miniſtrations and graces of the ſpirit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt here offers her a white rayment of his own making, for a covering of this her ſhame and nakedneſs, to wit a miniſtry of officers and ordinances, ſquared out in the Temple of God's holy Word, for call, for miſſion, for matter, for form, and not according to humane invention, notwithſtanding which ſhe might be naked ſtill, open to ſhame ſtill, and miſerable ſtill. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That the rayment of Christs making is the only rayment that will reach all our neceſsities, and cover all our nakedneſs; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther garments will come ſhort of this work.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap>e a linſey-woolſey garment, partly of Chriſts and partly of our own commixture, it would be like that in the Law, that was partly linnen and partly woollen, an abomination unto the Lord, yea for all that we might be cold and naked. Chriſts garment is ſuch a garment that it will reach us from top to toe, that no part of our ſhame or nakedneſs ſhall appear: Sin brings ſhame, and ſin brings contempt and nakedneſs upon us, and Chriſts rayment is a white rayment, an inocent rayment, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious honorable rayment, it will cover all our ſhame and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore worth the buying; our own rayments are ſpotted, defiled, and will not ſerve the turn, but Chriſts is white all over. If we expect to appear perfectly righteous, holy and juſt before God (or otherwiſe we ſhall never appear before him to approbation, for no unclean thing ſhall enter into his preſence) then we muſt be ſure to cloath our ſelves in the white rayment of this our elder brother. In the next place, if we have a deſire to have the nakedneſs, ſhame, contempt and ſcorn that is caſt upon
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53073:172"/>
our churches, and is obvious to the whole world, to be healed, covered, and done away; then let us make haſte, and clothe our ſelves with this white rayment that Chriſt does counſel us to buy of him; that is, let us ſpeedily look into the holy Veſtry of Chriſt's Word, and ſee what Garments Chriſt hath provided for his Spouſe there: <hi>The King's Daughter is all glorious within; yea thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee, Cant.</hi> 4.7, 11. <hi>and the ſmell of thy garments are like the ſmell of Lebanon.</hi> When we caſt off Chriſt's order in Diſcipline, church ordinances, offices, and miſſions, we caſt off Chriſt's white rayment, and preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our ſhame and nakedneſs to the eye of the whole world. It was the advice of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe thy youth.</hi> And why? Becauſe he had on the white rayment of Chriſt's true Miniſtery, and according to Chriſt's minde, which garment is ſo full of Majeſty, though <hi>Timothy</hi> was but a youth, yet being clothed therewith, it rendered him not only above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but truly gracious and honourable in the eyes of all. Some in the room of this, of Chriſt's own white rayment to cover their ſhame and nakedneſs, think it ſufficient that they have their ſilken coats, or their formal Rochets, a call from a rich perſonage, and ſome Lording Prelates, and then all is well; but alas, they ſee not that they are miſerable and naked for all this: Though I ſhould not contemn moderate and modeſt garments, yet <hi>Elijah</hi> in his hayrie mantle, or <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in his leather girdle, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Camels hair in the way of Chriſt, will attain the honour of true Prophets unto themſelves, whilſt the ſilken Prieſts in their own way, lye naked unto the ſhame and contempt of all: I ſpeak not this to the reproach of any, but to diſcharge my conſcience, like a good Phiſitian, muſt ly ope the wound, and ſearch it fully before he'll cure it; or like a faithful Pilot, that will diſcover the dangerous ſhelves and Rocks to all paſſengers, that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the danger, and if I be judged by any to have ſaid too much herein, or beſide the purpoſe, I anſwer in the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. <hi>For whether we be beſide our ſelves, it is to God, or whether we be ſober, it is for your ſakes Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the laſt place, Chriſt adviſeth <hi>Laodicea, To anoint her eyes with Eye-ſalve.</hi> Indeed ſhe was dark and blinde to purpoſe, and therefore had need of Eye-ſalve to make her ſee the way to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs: And where is ſhe to get it? But from Chriſt, who applyeth the whole remedy for her diſeaſe, Gold to relieve her poverty, white Rayment to cover her nakedneſs, and Eye-ſalve to cure her blindneſs. Hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That they that will truly ſee the way to eternal life, muſt come to Chriſt to receive Eye-ſalve from him.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>I anſwer, Very much, it being added as a motive, reaſon, or argument to the church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> to uſe the remedy which Chriſt counſels her unto: If Chriſt will not ſpare his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they refuſe his counſel, it is time for them to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to be more zealous, and repent.

rod, a bitter rod, even for thoſe his profeſſed children too, a quite caſting off, and ſpewing them out of his mouth for ever.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how can Chriſt be ſaid to love ſuch that he ſo bitterly chaſtiſeth?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Chriſt chaſtiſeth his children, not to deſtroy them, but to bring them to amendment, and to ſave them, if poſſibly he may: Chriſt's rod of Diſcipline is not a deſtructive rod, but according to that of <hi>David, With thy rod and ſtaff thou hast ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me;</hi> and therefore he tells <hi>Laodicea</hi> here, that ſhe ſhould not deſpair of his gracious acceptance, for the great puniſhment that was coming on her, for he tells her, that they are ſuch as he loves whom he rebukes and chaſtens; and therefore adds, <hi>Be Zealous, and repent,</hi> if ſhe expects his fatherly goodneſs to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued towards her.</p>
                  <p>Here are two degrees of this chaſtiſement, Reproof, and a Smiting: Whence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>When the word of reproof will not ſerve turn to reclaim obſtinate ſinners, a ſmiting chaſtiſement muſt be added thereunto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the word of reproof will not faſten on a Delinquent, the ſtroke of Diſcipline muſt; but always in Chriſt's order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, not preſently, paſſionately, and raſhly, but adviſedly, ſoberly, and in love, according to the advice of the Apoſtle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond or third admonition, that is, after ſeveral ways ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his recovery, and all in vain, then ſuch an obſtinate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is to be rejected, and chaſtiſed with the ſharp rod of Diſcipline: What elſe is to be expected after Chriſt's long admonitions and reproofs towards us, but that he ſhould come with his ſharp rods and chaſtiſements towards us, when all his convincements will do us no good, nor his rebukes draw any profit or fruits of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from us. Surely if he do love us, he will chaſten us, which is another Note.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 2. <hi>That as many as Chriſt loves, them he chastens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we be children, and not baſtards, his rod ſhall walk among us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7, 8. Think it not ſtrange when the Saints of God are afflicted chaſtiſed, and corrected, it is becauſe they are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe they are ſons, and beloved of God; if we were not of his family, he would leave us alone, to run on in our own perverſe ways, until deſtruction and hell overwhelmed us.</p>
                  <q>Be zealous therefore, and repent</q>
                  <p>What zeal is, ſee formerly on the fifteenth and ſixteenth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

                  <p>Chriſt adds here another motive to the poor blinde Laodice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to come unto him for gold, for white rayment, for eye-ſalve, to ſupply all their wants, which is drawn from his willingneſs and readineſs to come in and converſe with all ſuch that are but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive him, and to cloſe with him; and therefore he tells them, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock.</hi> Chriſt comes as one deſiring to have entrance, he knocks firſt, that they may know to whom it is that they muſt open: Chriſt coming in his firſt grace, is irreſiſtable, and as the ſtrong man, diſpoſſeſſes Satan, and takes poſſeſſion of the houſe, the ſoul, by a ſpiritual force and over-powering hand: But if the ſoul, after faith received, by its own ſloth, remiſneſs, or backſliding, ſhall ſhut the door or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance thereof againſt the kindly operations of Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Chriſt is not obliged to break up the door of that heart again by violence, as at his firſt coming in unto it, but will come and call, and knock for entrance, that is, will wait with mercies, with providences, with precepts, commands, with exhortations and reproofs, that if poſſible, to melt the ſtraying and erring ſoul into compunction, and to open again unto him, that the King of glory may enter in.

make them ſee their danger, if they continue obſtinate unto his calls: and laſtly, he ſends his Ambaſſadours with precept upon precept, and line upon line, beſeeching in Chriſt's name the ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls to return unto him: Chriſt will never be wanting to them unleſs they be wanting unto themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why does not Chriſt himſelf uſe his force, and open the door himſelf by his Spirits power to theſe poor Laodiceans: Is not he the great Key-bearer of <hi>David,</hi> who openeth, and no man ſhutteth; and if he would but ſpeak the word, he need not ſtand knocking at their doors, they would fly open to him, that he might enter in?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. 'Tis true, At Chriſt's firſt entring into the ſoul, our baſe natures are ſo reſiſtable and abhorrent to the work of grace, that he muſt come by force, by a ſpiritual force, with his Key of <hi>David,</hi> to unlock the doors of our hearts, if he will have an entrance thereinto. But ſecondly, Having firſt ſhed abroad his firſt grace into our hearts, then he commands us to work in the power of that grace to work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling; <hi>Having received the promiſes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>clenſe your ſelves from all filthineſs:</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and Chriſt puts us then upon doing, that we may ſtir up our graces, improve our talents, and become active, growing, and fruitful chriſtians: and on this account Chriſt here knocks at the door of the hearts of the church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and bids her to hearken to his voice, and ro open to him. She had received the firſt grace of faith from Chriſt, or elſe ſhe could not be numbred among the ſeven golden candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, though ſhe was a ſad, diſorderly, and ruſty one, yet ſhe was a church of Chriſt ſtill, and therefore might very well be commanded to ſet her power and grace a working, to open unto Chriſt, the operations of whoſe Spirit ſhe had ſhut out and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by her uneven carriage and luke-warm temper.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and in the laſt place, Know that <hi>Laodicea</hi> had not quite ſhut the door to Chriſt, as unto the operation of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſhe was a church of Chriſt, though a luke-warm one: but ſhe had ſhut the door, and denied him paſſage in ſome of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, by which Chriſt uſually and ordinarily enters; ſhe had ſhut the door unto a true ſpiritual Miniſtery, Diſcipline, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly calls, and regular diſpenſing of his Ordinances, and inſtead thereof, entertains a formal, lazy, indifferent luke-warm Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, State-diſcipline, Officers, and calls, and ſo all Ordinances are brought to the ſcantling of the will of man, not of God, or of Chriſt, and ſo makes up a mongrel Hermaphroditical worſhip, part of God's, and part of man's, which indeed is purely neither God's, nor man's, and therefore an abomination both to God and man: She had ſhut this door and way of entrance againſt Chriſt, as ſome of our churches has done this day, and therefore Chriſt comes and knocks; and how? By the Miniſtery of his
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53073:174"/>
Word, and faithful Witneſſes: And as <hi>John</hi> was ſent with an Epiſtle in his hand to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and the reſt of the delinquent Aſian churches. ſo Chriſt ſends his faithful Teachers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets with a burden in their mouths, againſt all ſuch falſe worſhip and doctrine, to unſhut the doors, if it may be, that the King of glory may enter in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> From the diſcourſed premiſſes it plainly appears, That this Scripture ſtands little in ſtead unto the Papiſts, and their champion <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his book of <hi>Grace and Free will, cap.</hi> 1. to maintain from hence their Pelagian doctrine, The power of mans Free-will before converſion unto Faith, and amendment: For <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> therein triumphantly interrogates, were not he fooliſh that would knock at his neighbours door, if he knew for certain that there were no man within that could open? It is true, it were ſo, but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (for all his great learning) herein is much miſtaken: Chriſt here knocks at a door where there was one within that was able to open, the party was only aſleep, he was not dead, or quite departed from his houſe, and therefore he knocks, and calls unto him to awake and open unto him; like the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> 5.2. She was aſleep <hi>when her beloved came and knocked, ſaying, Open to me my Siſter, my Love, my Dove, my Undefiled.</hi> So Chriſt comes to the church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> verſ. 2. and bids her, to <hi>awake and ſtrengthen the things that remain:</hi> and commands <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> to <hi>open unto him,</hi> who had a power and ability to open, though it was grown weak and remiſs, and therefore had need of a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a vigorous call to rouſe her up unto her duty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is quite miſtaken when from hence he aſſerts, That Chriſt bids the reprobate and unregenerate to open to him; it is only a believing church, a backſlidden luke-warm believing church, that he bids to riſe up and open to him, it is not one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together dead, but a ſleepy, careleſs, luke-warm church that he ſtirs up to this duty of opening to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly I anſwer, Though it were granted <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that Chriſt ſomtimes knocks at the doors of Reprobates and unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſons, and calls to open to him, though they neither will or can open to him, yet Chriſt may do this (as often he does) without any impeachment to his wiſdom; he hereby ſhows what their duty is, and requires it from them, and juſtly he may, though they are not in a poſſibility to perform it, they having forfeited and loſt their ability by their own fault, not only in their common parent, the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo by walking in the ſame ſteps of diſobedience with him; and Chriſt is not bound by any Law to reſtore it again unto them. And therefore Chriſt in the laſt place does often call to open to him upon the very reprobate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as in a judiciary way, for the aggravation of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation upon their refuſal, according to that of <hi>John</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had no ſin, but now they
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53073:175"/>
have no cloak for their ſin.</hi> Thus much in anſwer to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and his doctrine of Free-will, and the power of the meerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man in the works of grace and faith; which are in the firſt place to be wrought by the Spirit, to be nouriſhed by the Spirit, to be conſummated and perfected by the ſame Spirit. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As if Chriſt had ſaid, If any man will be obedient to the word of my mouth, opening the door of their hearts, yeilding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to my many and earneſt ſolicitations, I will then come and dwell in that ſoul, and impart my ſelf unto him, and ſup with him; that is, communicate, and have mutual fellowſhip with him, and he with me. Note hence,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>That it is the Saints highest priviledge, to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt, and he with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where there are thoſe heavenly intercourſes, there is a heaven upon earth, or earth aſcending into heaven, and heaven coming down upon earth; perſons hereby do become the Temples of the holy Spirit: <hi>I will come in to him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; that is, Chriſt will dwell in him ſpiritually, really, operatively by his grace: <hi>and he ſhall dwell in me;</hi> that is, by faith: and ſo ſuch become and are made the ſons of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.5. and are made partakers of his holy nature. Is it not a great ſhame to our chriſtian church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to deny themſelves this great priviledge, in not hearkning to the voice of Chriſt, or opening the door unto him? It is true, we are ready to hearken to the voice of Chriſt, ſo far as ſtands with our intereſt, that we may not be accounted heathens abroad in the world, and indeed that is all, if it will amount ſo far; for the ordinance of preaching is no diſtinguiſhing Ordinance, <hi>Go Teach all Nations:</hi> and the Ordinances of Prayer and Praiſe, are but natural duties, which all perſons in the world are bound unto as well as chriſtians: but where is the opening the door to Chriſt in his eſpecial diſtinguiſhing Ordinances? Where is the mutual feaſting, ſupping, and communicating between Chriſt and his churches in his holy Ordinances of the Supper, taſting and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſeveral and various gifts of the Spirit of Chriſt in his members? Where is the improving of his Diſcipline? Where are his Gardens encloſed? Are not all like a Forreſt or Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without any culture or hedge about them? 'Tis true, there are ſome few gardens, whoſe ſavoury ſpices, and precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does caſt a ſweet ſmelling ſavour abroad; but their tender Grapes are but weak, and it is to be feared, if God's mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not, that either the little Foxes will undermine them, or the wild Boar root them out: I ſpeak it according to my judgement and conſcience, that our contentation and ſitting ſatisfied under a formal and luke-warm preaching, and ſome other natural du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53073:175"/>
only, will be a means to provoke God to ſpew us out of his mouth for our half way Religion; the one ought to be done, and the other not left undone: we ought to have a reſpect to the whole will of God, not ſo far only as our carnal wiſdom thinks ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and no farther. It was once, and not long ſince, a juſt complaint, That common Prayer and other church Diſcipline, and Epiſcopal Ruling, had thruſt out of doors a true preaching, and divers other holy Ordinances of Chriſt: But obſerve the change, now it is to be feared, that preaching will ſilence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate many other of the Ordinances of Chriſt, and render them uſeleſs to us: Therefore we are to hearken to the voice of God, the whole voice of God, and open to it, if we expect Chriſt to come in, and to ſup with us, and we with him. We are firſt to hearken to his Word, open the door to him of our hearts in the preaching thereof; then we are to proceed, and not ſit ſtill, as thoſe ſilly ones <hi>that are ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge or practiſe of the truth;</hi> we are to go on to the work of perfection; that is, to walk in all the Ways and Ordinances of Chriſt, which will build up our ſouls unto the meaſure of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man in Chriſt, and make us wiſe indeed unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I conceive there is more in theſe words, <hi>I will ſup with him, and he with me,</hi> then a ſpiritual participating of Chriſt in his Ordinances in this life. The words have reſpect unto futurity, and the other life, as the next verſe intimates, and that of <hi>Luke</hi> 13.29. <hi>Then ſhall they come from the Eaſt, and Weſt, North and South, and ſhall ſit at Table in the Kingdom of God:</hi> And when is that time? But in that day when <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the faithful ſhall appear in the Kingdom of Chriſt, and all the wicked thruſt out of doors, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. And this is that which Chriſt intimateth in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. to his Diſciples after his laſt Supper, <hi>That henceforth he would not drink of this fruit of the Vine, until that day when he ſhould drink it new with them in his Fathers Kingdom.</hi> Chriſt will again feaſt, communicate, and entertain mutual fellowſhip with his Diſciples, before the ultimate end; though not in a carnal and ſenſual manner, yet in a more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritual manner; and therefore it is called New Wine, in reſpect it is received not in the old common way, but in a more ſingular and ſpiritual way and manner: it is called new, as <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> that comes down from God is called new, in reſpect of its perfection, the old being paſſed away: And that day when this heavenly Supper or Feaſt will be, is, when that Royal Nuptial feaſt is prepared, at that wedding mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.2, 9. for the heavenly Bride, the Lamb's wife, when <hi>Abraham. Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the faithful, ſhall ſit at Table together with Chriſt in his moſt glorious and happy Millenary Reigne and Kingdom: and I can ſee no inconvenience why this ſhould not be ſo literally underſtood, it being a ſure rule in interpreting Scriptures, That
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53073:176"/>
we are not to depart from the plain literal ſenſe thereof, unleſs there be ſome evident cauſe to the contrary, as being contrary to the coherence, againſt the Analogie of faith, or ſome other more plain and expreſs Scriptures: But this ſenſe accords and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes with a full conſort of other Scriptures; and therefore <hi>Piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> well obſerves upon this of <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. <hi>Quare non videtur hoc intelligendum de Vino, quod una cum Diſcipulis biberet Dominus poſt Reſurrectionem ſuum.

                  <p>Chriſt here adds a third reaſon to the luke-warm <hi>Laodiceans</hi> to come unto him, it being by way of reward, a Throne: Chriſt tells the ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> Matth. 20.23. <hi>That to ſit on his right hand, and on his left, is not his to give;</hi> but he having ſince by his death purchaſed this power into his hands, <hi>for all power is given unto him in heaven and in earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. He has a juſt right to diſpoſe and grant to ſit with him in his Throne to all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Saints; Chriſts Throne here, and the Father's are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed, as two diſtinct Thrones, and not one and the ſame: <hi>Subordinata,</hi> or <hi>diverſa, non ſunt contraria:</hi> My Throne, and the Father's Throne carries a variety, not a contrariety in them. The Son is not the Father, neither is the Father the Son. So neither is the Son's Throne the Father's Throne, nor on the other ſide, the Father's Throne the Son's Throne. Chriſt will have his Throne as God-man here on earth, wherein himſelf and members ſhall have a ſhare, though inferiour unto the Head; for they ſhall reigne on earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10. and the Father has his Throne, the higheſt heaven of glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.1. where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now this cannot be commodiouſly applyed
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53073:176"/>
to the Father's Throne, which Chriſt at preſent enjoyeth in the higheſt heavens: that is the Holieſt of Holies into which Chriſt is entered, a place only meet for Angelical hallelujahs, and ſpirits of men made perfect, not for ruling, reigning, judging and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his obſtinate enemies, which he (as man) muſt do on earth. But more of this hereafter. Only hence Note,</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. <hi>That the time is yet to come when Chriſt is to have a Throne of his own, on which, together with him, the overcoming Saints ſhall ſit and reigne on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this Throne is to commence in futurity, is plain from Chriſt's promiſe made here to the overcoming Saints, long after Chriſt's aſcenſion into the Father's Throne; and that it ſhall be here on earth, is plain from <hi>cap.</hi> 5. 10. where the Elders trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſong does clear it: <hi>Thou hast made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts, and we ſhall reigne on earth,</hi> compared to chap 20 v. 11. and that of <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.5. <hi>Bleſsed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth;</hi> all is in the future tenſe: for I am ſure experience ſhews, they have not yet inherited the earth, for they have in all paſt times complained, We have been ſtrangers and Pilgrims; and in all ages hitherto afflicted, diſtreſſed, and perſecuted, as ſervants, and never as yet inherited the earth, that is become the only Lords as the true heirs and proprietors thereof, and therefore yet to come. I ſhall only add that of <hi>Luke</hi> 20.28, 29, 30. <hi>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations, and I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me: That ye may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom, and ſit on Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> I ſee no inconvenience of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words literally, as unto the general ſcope thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ancient rule; <hi>Non eſt a litera ſeu propria Scripturae ſignificatione reced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>In this laſt Scripture take notice, 1. What therein is promiſed as a peculiar reward to them that abide temptations with or for Chriſt: and it is a Kingdom, Chriſt's Kingdom, <hi>my Kingdom,</hi> verſ. 30. compare this with <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.18. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt appoints unto them a Kingdom as his Father had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to him a kingdom, but the Father (as is on all ſides agreed) appointed not a particular kingdom for Chriſt, after the ultimate judgement in the ſupernal heavens; for it is affirmed on all hands, that Chriſt then and there ſhall deliver up the Kingdom, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ruling into the hands of the Father, that God may be all
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53073:177"/>
in all, according to that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 28. Now in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there are relations, perſons to rule, and perſons ruled, to wit, Chriſt and his Saints to rule, and unbelievers to be ruled: but in the higheſt heavens there is nothing to be made ſubject to Chriſt and his Saints, no unbeliever or unclean thing muſt enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, the bleſſed Angels, the miniſtring Spirits, being only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13, 14. Neither can this be meant of Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom, wherein Believers then were, and in all ages formerly, and therefore cannot be meant of this Kingdom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and propheſied of in this Scripture: Beſides, the ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt is called often by <hi>John,</hi> the Kingdom o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, wherein the Saints endure temptations, afflictions, and tryals, which Chriſt here mentions, and ſo cannot with the leaſt reaſon ſignifie the Kingdom of Reward, which Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth as the effects, crown, reſult, and reward of that enduring and patience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Eating, drinking, and ſuch actions, are unſutable actions and expreſſions to ſignifie the glory of the higheſt heavens; but very ſutable to expreſs Chriſt's glorious Kingdom here on earth, for it is promiſed as a Paradice, and a Tree of life therein, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.2. And it is ſuch a high ſpiritual eating and drinking, it being as yet a hidden Manna unto us, that we cannot poſſibly comprehend the excellency thereof, but under Types and Figures meet for our capacities.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The conquering Saints are to ſit on Thrones to judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael: In Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom this was never yet done, but ſuch were rather judged and trampled under foot by the powers of the world, and Antichriſt, and in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeſt ultimate glory there is nothing to be judged, neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons nor things; for that is the Father's Throne, wherein Chriſt ſhall lay down all Authority, and himſelf be alſo ſubject unto the Father, as that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24 25, 28.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this Kingdom here meant, which Chriſt calls <hi>My Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>My Throne,</hi> is yet to come here on earth before the ultimate day of judgement, and the Saints higheſt ſtate of glory in the ſupreameſt heavens, which is the Father's Throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will object, That this which is called Chriſt's Kingdom, is alſo the ſame with the Father's Kingdom, and not diſtinct from it, but one and the ſame, and to this purpoſe urge that Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. <hi>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the Vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom.</hi> Now that which you interpret to be the Son's Kingdom, is here called the Father's Kingdom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, 'Tis true, The Son's Kingdom is called in Scripture the Father's Kingdom, for divers reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Father gives it to Chriſt, and therefore he is called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>His King.</hi>

                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:53073:177"/>2. Becauſe the Father and the Son are one by an unſpeakable Union, and ſo the Kingdom of the Son, may be called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Father; that is the Kingdom of God: for Father is often aſcribed in Scripture to the Godhead, as that of <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal, that they know thee,</hi> to wit, the Father, <hi>to be the only true God,</hi> &amp;c. And by reaſon of the union of both natures in one perſon, Chriſt; it is called <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The Kingdom of Chriſt, and of God:</hi> and <hi>The Throne of God and the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 22.3. <hi>in the holy City, the New Jeruſalem.</hi> So that Chriſt, as man, as one with the Father, or God, reigns in this happy millenary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo may be alſo called the Father's Kingdom, wherein he will drink his new wine with his faithful ones before the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate day of judgement, ſo this makes not at all againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Kingdoms of the Father and Chriſt, which is before aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and plainly evidenced from divers Scriptures; Let the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious enquiring Reader, read more at large in D. <hi>Homes,</hi> M. <hi>Maton,</hi> and M. <hi>Mede</hi> hereon, and verſ 12. of this chapter.</p>
                  <p>But for a more full explicating and opening the Truth of this point, underſtand, That Chriſt's Kingdom in Scripture hath a diverſe acceptation. Firſt, Chriſt is King by right of creation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and this is his natural Kingdom, which he hath as one God with the Father from everlaſting. Secondly, Chriſt is King by right of Purchaſe; as the firſt, he rules and governs all the Kings and Nations of the world, and ſo is King of Kings: But by the ſecond, he governs more eſpecially his church and people; and this he does as God-man, and is properly called Chriſt's Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Kingdom. And this his Mediatory Kingdom hath in it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers periods, ſome more lowly; ſome more exaltant and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. Chriſt was a born King; witneſs the <hi>Magi's</hi> enquiry after him that was born King of the Jews, and their majeſtique preſents of Gold, Myrrh, and Frankincenſe; but his power was then but obſcure and low, which appeared afterwards ſomwhat more radiant, in impoſing his commands, doctrines, and ordinances upon his followers and diſciples; but this was but dark, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lowly alſo; as an Heir in his minority: After his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Aſcenſion, he commands his Agents and Ambaſſadors to negotiate the great affairs of his Kingdom in his abſence, by the help and concomitancy of his Spirit with them; and this is therefore called Chriſt's Spiritual or Miniſterial Kingdom, which is to continue unto his ſecond coming, the great work wherein is, to preach the Meſſias, and his Doctrine of Faith, and his ſecond coming: but this is mixed too with a great deal of affliction, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and obſcurity. But there is another period of this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Kingdom of Chriſt, which is moſt glorious and triumphant, and that is, at his laſt appearance, when all theſe low diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be done away, when he ſhall reigne, and none ſhall let; All other periods were mixed with much tears and ſorrow: but in
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53073:178"/>
this they ſhall be quite wiped off. In this laſt period there is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, not only as God, but as man, or rather as God-man, Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all people, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Languages ſhould ſerve him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>f me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy poſſeſſion:</hi> Now this cannot with any reaſon be attributed to that Kingdom which Chriſt had as God with the Father by right of Creation in the firſt ſenſe, becauſe it is to be given to the Son of Man coming in the clouds by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of days, long after the time of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s propheſie; and Chriſt had long before the time of <hi>Daniel,</hi> even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that natural Kingdom of his, as one with the Father. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecondly can it be applyed with any more ſhew of reaſon to the ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt now under the Goſpel, becauſe how few of the Nations of the world, and Languages, do as much as own or profeſs the name of Chriſt? It being, as ſome Learned obſerve, and that aright, That not a tenth part of all the Nations and Tongues in the world, do as much as own or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Name of Chriſt: and then again, among thoſe that profeſs Chriſt, how great a part thereof are Apoſtate Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians and even violent perſecutors of the Truth, as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? Yea again, conſider how few of thoſe in the Reformed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where the Goſpel of Chriſt is in more clearneſs and light diſcovered and preached, are truly ſincere ſervants of Chriſt, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting with cheerfulneſs unto the Scepter of his righteouſneſs, owning Chriſt and godlineſs in the power thereof? Therefore ſurely this Kingdom and happy period is yet to come, as Chriſt ſays, <hi>John</hi> 18.36. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world;</hi> that is, of this preſent world: but that that is to come after the Reſurrection, and wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs, and is here promiſed as a reward to the overcoming Saints, and for which we pray in the Lord's prayer, <hi>Thy Kingdom come;</hi> which will not be given by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of days unto the Son of man, until he comes in the clouds, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. compared to <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I ſhall add one humane teſtimony, and I believe, will not be the leaſt with ſome; and that is, of our late Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in their Annotations only on two Scriptures, to prove the matter and ſubſtance I contend for; to wit, a more glorious tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant ſtate of the church of Chriſt before the ultimate day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They in their new Annotations, on <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10. <hi>And we ſhall reigne on earth,</hi> confeſs; That this may ſignifie the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times of the church under chriſtian Kings and Emperours; <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.11. <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> And on <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25, 26. they ſay, <hi>Hold faſt till I come,</hi> ſignifies, Till Chriſt's ſecond coming, general or ſpecial. <hi>Power over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſignifies, To joyn with Chriſt in judging the Nations, &amp;c.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53073:178"/>
And, that <hi>giving the Morning Star,</hi> ſignifies, Chriſt's giving the full fruition of himſelf. Thus far they: Which is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the full extent thereof, and therefore yet to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in futurity.</p>
                  <p>But here by the way I ſhall take leave to ſhow their great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, that expect a triumphant ſtate of the church, or that Chriſt's Reigne or Monarchy ſhall be ſet up in his church, before Chriſt's ſecond appearance in the clouds to accompliſh this work. This opinion is not a little dangerous and pernicious both unto the peace and quiet of the Saints, and unto all Magiſtracy that ſuch opinioniſts live under: for once entertain the judgement that Chriſt's Kingdom is now to be ſet up, all other Oppoſites and Kingdoms muſt down before it: for who would count it a hard ſaying, or ſinful, to remove humane Powers, and Magiſtrates, be they ever ſo juſt, that ſtands in the way of the ſetting up of the all-righteous Scepter of Chriſt? Is it not on this very ground and principle that every party and faction that pretends higheſt to Chriſt, hath endeavoured to ſet it ſelf in the Throne? How was Epiſcopacy dethroned, but that Presbyterie thought it ſelf of Divine Right, and up the Kingdom of Chriſt muſt go with them? Whether Prelacy or Presbytery be of the Diviner or better Size, that is not the diſpute, but having once entertained the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt that the Kingdom of Chriſt did conſiſt in their <hi>Geneva</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del and Presbyterie; what Nation was at peace among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, before it was exalted and had the Throne? Again, This principle being again entertained by ſome others pretending to more holineſs and truth then they; O! How they labour for an eruption, like an inbred wind within the bowels of the earth, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at reſt, till it ſets up its intereſt, or its pretended Kingdom of Chriſt up at top? Was not this the very principle and fancy that carried on thoſe irregular heads of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> &amp;c. that made them dream of a new State come down among them from God, when they were as weak, frail, and ſinful, as any others? Did not this excite them to contemn all Powers and Magiſtracy whatſoever, and to tread all under foot that ſtood in the way of their new <hi>Camaera?</hi> And is not this again attempted and acted by ſome in our days that have taken up the ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And who knows where it will reſt being once ſet on foot, or working by a fiery irregular zeal? Judicious M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his preface to his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy,</hi> though an Epiſcopal man, yet wiſely foreſaw the evil of this judgement and principle, and gave forewarning of the danger of it: It did deſtroy Epiſcopacy, and it will deſtroy Presbyterie, and all Government whatſoever, if it be not moderated and wiſely regulated by an over-maſtering ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace: and herein I hope I have done but my duty, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my conſcience, in ſhowing the falſe ground of many mens miſcarriages about the proſecution and attainment of this
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53073:179"/>
Kingdom of Chriſt, which indeed will never be attained to in this infirm and corrupt generation, which is partly ſpiritual, and partly carnal, and they that endeavour to ſet it up, may juſtly periſh in the attempt, being not called to it, neither by God nor Chriſt: Neither let any ſay hence, that I contemn full and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavours of reforming of the Doctrine and Diſcipline of our churches unto the primitive pattern; this is all that is required at our hands, when God opens a door unto us unto this work, it is not to ſet up the church triumphant before Chriſt ſhall appear to be her Captain and Leader on, which then will be with great power and might, and none ſhall hinder: we are now command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer, and to overcome our temptations patiently, not to reigne and triumph, which is reſerved as a reward of our patience unto another life. He that thus overcometh, ſhall ſit down with Chriſt in his Throne, and reigne with him, whiles others may be ſhut out for their ſin of rebellion and diſobedience to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they live under.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewed the danger of this falſe principle, to wit, an expectancy to reigne with Chriſt at preſent, let all wiſe chriſtians ſhun it, as a ruinous houſe, that is ready to overwhelm all that is under it, and having plucked up the rotten prop, the building thereon muſt needs fall to ground, and come to nought; <hi>Cum tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur cauſa, tollitur effectus:</hi> and inſtead of this broken reed, let the faithful ſoul comfort and ſupport it ſelf in patience with the hopes of Chriſt's true and real Kingdom, wherewith <hi>John</hi> was affected and ſupported, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.9. which ſhall come in glory and great power: and none ſhall ſay as now, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>there is Chriſt,</hi> but he ſhall be moſt evident and perſpicuouſly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Lo, He cometh in the clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they that pierced him, and every one ſhall mourn becauſe of him, <hi>v.</hi> 7. This Kingdom of Chriſt is not advanced by any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious whimſies of ours, but is brought to light in power and great Majeſty, where Chriſt comes with his Armies, and myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads of Angels and raiſed Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.4. to take the Kingdom unto himſelf, when Antichriſt and all his adherents are deſtroyed by the appearance of the Lord Chriſt, then ſhall <hi>they fly unto the Rocks and the Mountains, and call to them to fall upon them, to hide them from the preſence of the Lamb that ſitteth on the Throne:</hi> and then <hi>all the Kingdoms of the world ſhall become the Kingdoms of our God, and his Chriſts; and he ſhall reign for ever and ever,</hi> Hallelujah, Amen.</p>
                  <p>And for a concluſion of all, let the faithful ones of Chriſt hearken to the often repeated admonition of the Spirit in the laſt verſe,</p>
